Strategy (Why This Approach?)
Weâ€™re using Azure-native tooling, Terraform, and Azure DevOps to align with the following strategic principles:

1. Cloud-Native & Supported Stack
Using Azure Image Builder (AIB), a native Azure service, ensures tight integration, support, and optimization.

Avoids reliance on third-party image tools unless needed for portability.

2. Immutable Infrastructure
Building custom images supports immutable VM deployments, reducing configuration drift and improving stability.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Managing image creation with Terraform ensures version control, repeatability, and automation.

It fits seamlessly into existing IaC pipelines.

4. CI/CD Integration
Azure DevOps provides strong CI/CD capabilities and native Azure integrations.

Using pipelines allows us to schedule image builds, trigger them on demand, or integrate them into larger deployment flows.

5. Security & Compliance
Centralized image creation ensures all VMs are built from secure, up-to-date base images.

Reduces risk from inconsistent manual VM setup.

6. Scalability via Shared Image Gallery
Using SIG allows sharing optimized images across regions, subscriptions, and scale sets for large environments.
