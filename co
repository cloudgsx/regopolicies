Research Terraform Best Practices:

Explore Terraform documentation and community standards.
Look into commonly followed best practices such as:
Code modularization.
Version control and state management.
Resource naming conventions.
Error handling and input validation.
Security practices (e.g., managing sensitive data).
Compile a List of Standards:

Organize the standards into categories such as security, structure, and maintainability.
Add clear examples for each best practice to illustrate how they should be applied.
Document Findings:

Create a document or wiki page summarizing the findings.
Include links to external references, if applicable, for deeper insights.
Address Code Quality Issues:

Identify common Terraform code quality issues, such as unused variables, hardcoded values, or unoptimized modules.
Suggest tools like tflint or terraform fmt for detecting and resolving these issues.
Acceptance Criteria:

Ensure the document includes a compiled list of standards.
Confirm that the standards are clearly defined and actionable.
Collaboration:

Share the draft with your team for feedback.
Incorporate any suggestions or updates they might have.
Deliverables
Compiled List of Standards: A comprehensive guide to Terraform coding standards.
Documented Best Practices: A clear, structured document or wiki summarizing the best practices.
