Summary of Hardcoding Issues
Component	Status	Recommendation
Resource Names	Compliant	No hardcoding issues.
Encryption at Host	Partially Hardcoded	Replace true with var.encryption_at_host_enabled for flexibility.
Admin SSH Key	Compliant	Parameterized, no hardcoding.
Accelerated Networking	Compliant	Parameterized, no hardcoding.
Subnet and NSG Configuration	Compliant	Parameterized, no hardcoding.
Tags	Compliant	Dynamically merged, no hardcoding.
Disk Configuration	Partially Hardcoded	Parameterize write_accelerator_enabled logic using a variable.
Boot Diagnostics	Compliant	Parameterized, no hardcoding.
Timeouts	Hardcoded	Replace hardcoded timeouts with variables (var.create_timeout, etc.).
Lifecycle Ignore Changes	Acceptable but Caution	Ensure this wonâ€™t lead to configuration drift. Periodically validate settings.
