Title: Engineering Roadmap: Defining Objectives, Efforts, and PoCs

Story Type: Epic / Story (depending on scope)

Description: As an engineering team, we need to define our strategic roadmap, including our objectives, efforts, and services from an overall service point of view. We aim to establish clarity on what we are trying to achieve from an engineering perspective, outline key efforts, and identify the Proof of Concepts (PoCs) that align with our goals.

Acceptance Criteria:

Define the engineering objectives and key focus areas.
Identify and document ongoing engineering efforts with an overall service perspective.
List the services we aim to develop, improve, or achieve.
Establish PoCs that align with our roadmap goals and feasibility assessment.
Provide a high-level timeline and priority matrix for execution.
Tasks/Subtasks:

 Define and document the core engineering goals.
 Map ongoing efforts to specific service areas.
 Identify key services to be developed/improved.
 Shortlist and evaluate potential PoCs.
 Align with stakeholders for final roadmap approval.
