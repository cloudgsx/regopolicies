ECP Provisioning Sprint Model â€“ New Hire Guidelines
Welcome to the ECP Cloud Foundation - Provisioning Team! As a new team member, this guide will help you understand how we manage our work using the sprint model in Jira.

1. Sprint Duration
Sprints are typically 2 weeks long.

Start and end dates are clearly defined (e.g., 09/Apr/25 to 22/Apr/25).

The sprint is labeled (e.g., ECPIAC.25.P2.S1) to help track progress and documentation.

2. Sprint Planning
Held at the beginning of each sprint to:

Review backlog items.

Prioritize tasks based on urgency and dependencies.

Assign tickets to team members.

3. Jira Board Overview
Tasks are tracked using Jira tickets (e.g., ECPIAC-2750).

Each task has:

A clear title and description.

A status (To Do, In Progress, Done, Blocked, etc.).

Assignees and watchers.

Linked epics or initiatives.

4. Ticket Types
Story: Feature or requirement to be implemented.

Bug: Error or defect to be fixed.

Task: General work item.

Sub-task: A component of a larger ticket.

5. Daily Standups
Quick 15-minute meeting to:

Share what you worked on yesterday.

What you're doing today.

Raise any blockers.

6. Best Practices
Keep your ticket status updated.

Add meaningful comments when progress is made or blockers arise.

Ensure tickets have acceptance criteria.

Link related tickets (e.g., dependencies, blockers).

Review assigned tasks before the sprint starts.

7. Sprint Review & Retrospective
End-of-sprint meeting to:

Demo completed work.

Get feedback from stakeholders.

Reflect on what went well and areas of improvement.

8. Communication & Collaboration
Use Slack or Teams for daily communication.

Collaborate with teammates and ask questions.

Document your work clearly for handoff or review.
