1. OS and Data Disks Encryption with a Customer-Managed Key
Purpose: Encrypting disks helps protect data at rest, ensuring that even if a disk is compromised, the data remains unreadable.
Customer-Managed Key Requirement: Using customer-managed keys provides additional control over encryption, allowing you to rotate and manage keys according to your security policies.
2. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Agent on Linux VMs
Purpose: Defender for Endpoint provides threat detection, monitoring, and response capabilities for your VMs.
Linux-Specific Requirement: Ensuring that Defender is enabled on Linux VMs helps to secure them from potential malware and attacks in a similar way as Windows VMs.
3. Blocking All Marketplace Images
Purpose: This restricts the usage of VM images to only approved ones, preventing unknown or potentially vulnerable images from being used in production.
Why It Matters: Using unknown images can introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors. Limiting to approved images ensures compliance with internal standards and security reviews.
4. Closing Ports That Expose Attack Vectors
Purpose: Open ports can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a VM.
Requirement: Only necessary ports should be open, reducing the attack surface and limiting potential points of unauthorized entry.
5. Disk Encryption Set Requirement for Customer-Managed Key Encryption
Purpose: A Disk Encryption Set is a resource in Azure used to manage encryption keys for VMs.
Why It’s Required: Ensuring a consistent approach to disk encryption allows for standardized management, security, and compliance.
6. Host-Level Encryption for Virtual Machines and Scale Sets
Purpose: Host-level encryption adds another layer of protection by encrypting data stored on the host.
Requirement: This policy ensures that data is protected not just at the disk level but also on the host machine.
7. Private Endpoints for Guest Configuration Assignments
Purpose: Private endpoints restrict access to resources over a private connection, rather than through public IPs.
Why It’s Important: Limiting access to configuration assignments over private endpoints minimizes the exposure of configuration management to public networks.
8. Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Management Ports
Purpose: JIT access allows management ports to be open only when needed, reducing the time they’re exposed.
Requirement: By limiting the time that ports like SSH or RDP are open, you decrease the window for potential attacks.
9. Network Security Groups (NSGs) for Internet-Facing VMs
Purpose: NSGs control the traffic to and from Azure resources, allowing or blocking specific types of network traffic.
Requirement: For VMs exposed to the internet, NSGs are critical for filtering malicious traffic and limiting exposure.
10. Disabling IP Forwarding on Virtual Machines
Purpose: Disabling IP forwarding prevents VMs from routing traffic, reducing risks related to network snooping or traffic manipulation.
Why It’s Required: This policy prevents the VM from acting as a network router, limiting the risk of network-based attacks.
11. Closing Management Ports on VMs
Purpose: Management ports (like SSH or RDP) should be closed when not in use to reduce exposure.
Why It’s Important: Open management ports are often the first target for attackers. Only opening them when needed (via JIT) improves security.
12. NSG Protection for Non-Internet-Facing VMs
Purpose: Even for internal-only VMs, NSGs help manage traffic and provide a first line of defense.
Requirement: Adding NSGs ensures that only trusted traffic can reach VMs, preventing lateral movement in case of a breach.
13. Remediation of Vulnerabilities in Security Configurations
Purpose: Ensures that any identified vulnerabilities are remediated to keep the VM compliant and secure.
Why It’s Important: Regularly addressing vulnerabilities reduces the risk of exploitation.
14. Restricting All Network Ports to NSG-Associated Security Groups
Purpose: Ensures that all traffic to and from VMs is controlled by NSGs, providing a unified way to manage security rules.
Requirement: This restricts traffic and makes sure all VM communication adheres to security standards.
15. Enabling Vulnerability Assessment Solutions
Purpose: Vulnerability assessments regularly check for known vulnerabilities in software, configurations, or access controls.
Why It’s Required: This proactive approach helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
16. Only Local Accounts with Allowed Permissions on Linux
Purpose: Restricting account types and permissions helps prevent unauthorized access.
Requirement: Only local accounts with specific permissions should exist, which reduces unnecessary access and aligns with the principle of least privilege.
17. Auditing Linux Machines for Remote Connections Without Passwords
Purpose: Ensures that remote connections are secure and require authentication.
Requirement: Prevents unauthorized access through open, passwordless connections.
18. Meeting Azure Security Baseline Requirements for Docker Hosts on Linux
Purpose: Docker hosts have specific security concerns; meeting baseline requirements ensures they’re secure.
Requirement: Docker hosts should be configured to meet Azure’s security standards to avoid common container vulnerabilities.
19. Enabling Azure Disk Encryption or Encryption-at-Host on Linux VMs
Purpose: Ensures data at rest is encrypted either at the disk or host level, protecting it from unauthorized access.
Requirement: This adds another layer of data protection on Linux VMs.
20. Auditing Linux Machines for passwd File Permissions Set to 0644
Purpose: Ensures the passwd file, which contains user information, is secure and not overly permissive.
Requirement: Setting file permissions to 0644 prevents unauthorized modifications, protecting user accounts and reducing risk.
21. Auditing Linux Machines for Accounts Without Passwords
Purpose: Accounts without passwords are an easy target for unauthorized access.
Requirement: This policy ensures all accounts have passwords, enforcing basic authentication standards.
Summary
These policies are designed to:

Protect Data: Through encryption, access control, and vulnerability assessment.
Control Access: By restricting ports, enforcing network security groups, and using JIT access.
Minimize Attack Surface: By disabling unnecessary services, ports, and protocols.
Ensure Compliance: By setting baseline configurations and auditing for risky settings.




=============================================================================



To make your VMs compliant with the policies listed, you can follow a series of steps for each policy category, using Azure's native tools and configuration management. Here’s a breakdown of the actions required to address each policy and bring your VMs into compliance:
