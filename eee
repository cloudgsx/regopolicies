Purpose:
Merge the latest foundational service Terraform modules into the Production PMR using Bitbucket. This will enable foundational modules for Terraform to work effectively in production.

Scope:
The epic involves enabling and deploying the following Terraform modules as separate stories:

AC3: ECPIC-1629: Add vm-disk attachment to VM in App L3 Landing Zone.
AC4: ECPIC-1636: Add data classification tag on Terraform ignore changes.
AC5: ECPIC-1872: Validate VM & VMSS after ignoring the changes to Custom Data.
AC6: ECPIC-1892: Re-validate Unit Testing of TFE - azure_virtual_gateway using Terraform test.
AC7: ECPIC-1800: Add optional parameters to load-balancer rule and probe.
AC8: ECPIC-2134: Update keyvault-premium module to publish module in CORP2 using XLR.
AC9: ECPIC-2124: Terraform Module Testing in QUA/UAT Env - Linux VM.
AC10: ECPIC-2125: Terraform Module Testing in QUA/UAT Env - OS Image.
AC11: ECPIC-2126: Terraform Module Testing in QUA/UAT Env - Storage Container.
AC12: ECPIC-2127: Terraform Module Testing in QUA/UAT Env - Storage Table.
AC13: ECPIC-2128: Terraform Module Testing in QUA/UAT Env - Storage Queue.
AC14: ECPIC-2130: Update OS-image module to publish module in CORP2 using XLR.
AC15: ECPIC-2135: Update keyvault-key module to publish module in CORP2 using XLR.
AC16: ECPIC-2136: Update storage-container module to publish module in CORP2 using XLR.
AC17: ECPIC-2137: Update storage-table module to publish module in CORP2 using XLR.

Epic Objective:
The goal of this epic is to enable and deploy the latest foundational Terraform module versions into the Production PMR (Project Management Repository) to enhance the stability, scalability, and functionality of infrastructure deployment. This includes the validation, testing, and release of multiple foundational modules, ensuring they meet quality standards and production readiness criteria.

Key Outcomes:

Enablement: Publish foundational Terraform modules (e.g., storage, networking, compute, and encryption) in the Production PMR.
Testing: Perform comprehensive testing across QUA, UAT, and CORP2/DEV environments, including regression and performance validation.
Updates: Enhance module documentation and output descriptions to improve usability and clarity for end users.
Deployment: Successfully release updated modules into the CORP2 environment with proper pre-work and support for the planned UAT release.
Risk Mitigation: Address dependencies, update naming conventions, and resolve known issues to ensure seamless deployment.
Scope of Work:
This epic covers the testing, validation, and enablement of the following foundational Terraform modules:

Storage-related modules (e.g., storage-account, storage-container, storage-table).
Compute modules (e.g., Linux VMs, OS images, VMSS).
Networking modules (e.g., express-route gateway).
Encryption and key management modules (e.g., keyvault-premium, disk-encryption).
Performance and regression testing for all modules.
