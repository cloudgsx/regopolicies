 Suggestions
[Suggestion] Consider extracting the conditional logic for account_replication_type and ip_rules into local variables. This improves readability and testability:

hcl
Copiar
Editar
locals {
  effective_replication_type = var.is_boot_diagnostic ? "GRS" : var.replication_type
  effective_ip_rules         = var.is_boot_diagnostic ? concat(var.bank_internet_proxy_ip, var.azure_serial_console_ip) : var.bank_internet_proxy_ip
}
Then reference these locals in the resource block instead.

[Suggestion] Add input validation for the new list variables (bank_internet_proxy_ip, Azure_serial_console_ip) to ensure they only accept valid CIDR blocks or IP addresses.

üíÖ Nitpicks
[Nitpick] Variable naming: Azure_serial_console_ip is capitalized while others (like bank_internet_proxy_ip) are lowercase. Suggest renaming to azure_serial_console_ip for naming consistency.

[Nitpick] You might want to alphabetize the variable declarations or group them more logically (e.g., networking-related together).

‚ùì Questions
[Question] Are there specific use cases where is_boot_diagnostic might be toggled at runtime, or is it intended to be static per environment?

[Question] Is there any audit requirement for IP source changes? If so, would it make sense to externalize these IP lists into a file (e.g., json or tfvars) for better visibility and diffing?

‚úÖ Praise
[Praise] Great job removing the hardcoded IPs and centralizing them into variables‚Äîhuge improvement in maintainability and reusability.

[Praise] The use of conditional logic makes the module more flexible without overcomplicating the implementation. Clean and pragmatic.

[Praise] Descriptions for variables are clear and concise. This is often overlooked and adds a lot of value for future maintainers.
