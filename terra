Epic Title:
Implement Terratest for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Validation and Automation

Epic Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I want to implement Terratest for automating infrastructure testing and validation of our Terraform modules,
so that I can ensure code quality, reduce manual testing efforts, and detect issues early in the deployment pipeline.

Objectives:
Automate testing for Terraform modules using Terratest.
Integrate Terratest into the CI/CD pipeline for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Provide automated validation for Terraform resources in different environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod).
Ensure compliance with infrastructure standards through automated checks.
Reduce manual effort and increase confidence in Terraform module deployments.
Acceptance Criteria:
Terratest framework is implemented to test key Terraform modules in a sandbox environment.
Automated tests validate the following:
Resource creation, updates, and deletions.
Dependency resolution (e.g., resources depend on one another).
Outputs and parameters for Terraform modules.
Terratest execution is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run on code commits or PRs.
Documentation includes:
Steps to execute Terratest locally and in CI/CD.
Sample test cases for commonly used Terraform modules.
Reporting mechanism for test results.
Results of the Terratest execution are logged and provide clear pass/fail statuses.
Definition of Ready:
Access to a sandbox environment for testing Terraform deployments.
List of priority Terraform modules to implement Terratest for (e.g., VM, Storage, Networking).
CI/CD pipeline access for integration.
Agreement on tools (e.g., GoLang, Terratest, Terraform versions) and test scenarios.
Definition of Done:
Terratest is successfully implemented for priority Terraform modules.
CI/CD integration is complete, and tests run automatically during PR checks or deployments.
Test results are visible and accessible to developers and stakeholders.
Documentation is created and shared with the team for running Terratest.
Approval from stakeholders that the implementation meets the required testing standards.
User Stories under this Epic:
Story 1:
Title: Set up Terratest framework for Terraform modules.
Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I want to set up the Terratest framework in the project,
so that I can write and execute automated tests for Terraform modules.

Story 2:
Title: Create automated tests for VM and Storage Terraform modules.
Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I want to write automated Terratest scripts for VM and Storage Terraform modules,
so that I can validate resource creation, updates, and deletions.

Story 3:
Title: Integrate Terratest execution into the CI/CD pipeline.
Description:
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to integrate Terratest into the CI/CD pipeline,
so that tests are triggered automatically during PR checks and deployments.

Story 4:
Title: Add test reporting and logs for Terratest execution.
Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I want to configure logging and reporting for Terratest execution,
so that I can view test results and debug failures easily.

Story 5:
Title: Document Terratest usage for the team.
Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I want to create documentation for running and maintaining Terratest scripts,
so that other team members can use and extend the tests efficiently.

Risks:
Learning Curve: Team members may require time to learn Terratest and GoLang.
Mitigation: Provide initial training or share learning resources.
Pipeline Overhead: Running tests in CI/CD may increase pipeline duration.
Mitigation: Optimize tests to focus on critical Terraform modules.
Resource Costs: Test execution may require additional cloud resources.
Mitigation: Use sandbox environments and tear down resources after testing.
Success Metrics:
Reduction in manual testing efforts for Terraform modules.
Faster detection and resolution of Terraform-related issues.
Automated test coverage for at least 80% of Terraform resources.
Integration of Terratest into the CI/CD pipeline with successful execution.
