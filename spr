Key Observations:
Velocity and Completion Rates:

The team's average velocity is 74 story points per sprint.
There is a consistent gap between committed story points and completed story points, indicating a pattern of overcommitment.
For example, in sprints:
ECP.IAC.24.P3.S6: 81 committed, only 25 completed.
ECP.IAC.24.P4.S5: 106 committed, only 46 completed.
Fluctuations in Performance:

Some sprints, like ECP.IAC.24.P4.S3 (105 completed out of 153 committed), show relatively higher completion, whereas others, like ECP.IAC.24.P3.S6, have significantly lower completion.
This variation could indicate challenges in either task estimation or execution consistency.
Alignment with Goals:

Frequent overcommitment might suggest issues in setting realistic sprint goals or unexpected blockers during execution.
Trends:

There is no clear upward or downward trend in completed story points across the listed sprints, but overcommitment is a recurring theme.
ECP.IAC.24.P4.S4 and ECP.IAC.24.P4.S2 show performance close to the average velocity, hinting that realistic commitments align better with team capabilities.
Actionable Insights for the Team:
Improvement in Sprint Planning:

The team should aim to commit closer to the average velocity of 74 story points.
A buffer for unforeseen challenges could help improve completion rates.
Retrospective Discussions:

Reflect on why some sprints, like ECP.IAC.24.P3.S6, had such a significant gap between commitment and completion.
Evaluate whether blockers, resource availability, or task estimation are contributing factors.
Focus on Task Estimation:

Encourage the team to refine their story point estimation process during planning sessions.
Use data from past sprints to guide more realistic commitments.
Track and Mitigate Overcommitment:

Implement measures to prevent overloading the sprint backlog.
Consider prioritizing high-impact items and leaving room for flexibility.
