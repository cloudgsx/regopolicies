Let's analyze why 100.114.2.0/28, 100.114.2.32/27, and 100.114.2.16/28 are incorrect when trying to divide 100.114.2.0/26 into one /27 and two /28s.

Step 1: Understanding the Assigned Ranges
We are given VNet Address Space: 100.114.2.0/26 (Total 64 IPs from 100.114.2.0 to 100.114.2.63).

To properly divide it, we need:

One /27 subnet (32 IPs)
Two /28 subnets (16 IPs each)
How the Incorrect Subnets are Allocated
Subnet Name	Given CIDR	IP Range
Ops-Web?	100.114.2.0/28	100.114.2.0 - 100.114.2.15
Ops-Business?	100.114.2.32/27	100.114.2.32 - 100.114.2.63
Ops-Data?	100.114.2.16/28	100.114.2.16 - 100.114.2.31
Step 2: Why is this Incorrect?
The /27 should be the first (largest) subnet, but it isn't.

A /27 needs 32 addresses.
Here, 100.114.2.32/27 is used for it, which is fine—but this means the first two /28s (small subnets) are placed in the wrong order.
The /28 subnets (100.114.2.0/28 and 100.114.2.16/28) are placed incorrectly.

These two /28 subnets should come after the /27 to avoid fragmentation.
Instead, 100.114.2.0/28 and 100.114.2.16/28 are cutting into where the /27 should be!
The /27 should be using 100.114.2.0/27, but instead, it starts at 100.114.2.32, which wastes space.
It breaks proper subnet hierarchy.

If you follow correct subnetting:
The first 32 IPs (100.114.2.0 - 100.114.2.31) should be assigned to the /27.
The next two /28s should take 100.114.2.32 - 100.114.2.63.
But in the incorrect allocation, the /28s are placed in the lower range where the /27 should be.
Step 3: The Correct Subnet Allocation
✅ Proper division for a /27 + two /28s
Subnet Name	Correct CIDR	Correct IP Range
Ops-Business	100.114.2.0/27	100.114.2.0 - 100.114.2.31
Ops-Web	100.114.2.32/28	100.114.2.32 - 100.114.2.47
Ops-Data	100.114.2.48/28	100.114.2.48 - 100.114.2.63
❌ Incorrect allocation that was provided
Subnet Name	Incorrect CIDR	Incorrect IP Range
Ops-Web?	100.114.2.0/28	100.114.2.0 - 100.114.2.15 ❌ (Should be /27 here)
Ops-Business?	100.114.2.32/27	100.114.2.32 - 100.114.2.63 ✅ (This is correct)
Ops-Data?	100.114.2.16/28	100.114.2.16 - 100.114.2.31 ❌ (Should be in the higher block)
Step 4: Why is the Incorrect Allocation a Problem?
It fragments the /27 allocation.

A /27 should be placed at the beginning (100.114.2.0/27) to keep things organized.
The incorrect plan places two /28 blocks in the first half, which means the /27 starts late (100.114.2.32).
This wastes some addresses and makes future subnetting harder.
It goes against logical subnet planning.

When designing networks, the largest subnet should be placed first so that smaller ones fit efficiently after it.
The correct method ensures no wasted or overlapping IPs.
Final Answer:
The incorrect allocation (100.114.2.0/28, 100.114.2.32/27, 100.114.2.16/28) is wrong because:

The /27 should come first (100.114.2.0/27), but instead, it's pushed to 100.114.2.32/27.
The two /28s are placed in a way that disrupts the expected order.
It makes the network harder to manage and wastes address space.
Thus, the correct subnetting should be:

100.114.2.0/27 (Ops-Business)
100.114.2.32/28 (Ops-Web)
100.114.2.48/28 (Ops-Data)
