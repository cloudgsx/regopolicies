Summary of the Landing Zone Architecture Diagram
This Azure Landing Zone architecture follows a structured approach to governance, security, networking, and application deployments within a cloud environment. It is divided into three key sections:

1Ô∏è‚É£ GIS (Governance & Monitoring)
CSQM Resource Group: Contains key governance components such as:
Log Analytics Workspace & Cluster: Centralized logging for monitoring.
Storage Account: Stores logs for auditing and analysis.
Key Vault: Secure storage for secrets and keys.
Alerts: Triggers for monitoring and security.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Platform Landing Zone (Core Infrastructure)
This section provides foundational networking, identity, and security services for workloads.

Core Components:
Hub Resource Group:

Express Route Circuit: Enables private connectivity between on-premises and cloud.
Express Route Gateway: Connects on-prem infrastructure to the Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
Private DNS Zones: Enables name resolution for private resources.
Hub VNet & Subnets: Network segmentation for security and traffic control.
Private Endpoints & NSGs: Secures resource access.
FinOps Resource Group:

Cost Alerts & Dashboards: Helps in monitoring cloud expenses.
Azure Monitor Private Link Scope: Secure integration with monitoring services.
Key Vault Resource Group:

Platform Key Vault: Centralized storage of encryption keys and secrets.
Network Flow Logs & Storage Account: Logs network traffic for security and compliance.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Application Landing Zone (Workload Deployment)
This section contains the application-specific infrastructure required for workload deployment.

Core Components:
Foundational Platform Resource Group:

Storage Account: Secure application data storage.
Key Vault: Stores secrets and encryption keys.
Disk Encryption Set & Network Flow Logs: Enhances security and compliance.
Private Endpoints & NSGs: Secures application components.
Application Resource Group:

Application VNet: Isolated network for applications.
Data, Business, and Web Subnets: Segmented application architecture.
VM Scale Set: Scalable compute resources.
Load Balancer: Manages traffic distribution to backend services.
üîπ Key Takeaways:
‚úÖ Layered Security & Governance: Separate GIS, Platform, and Application zones ensure structured cloud operations.
‚úÖ Networking & Connectivity: Uses Private Endpoints, NSGs, Express Route, and VNet Peering for security.
‚úÖ Scalability & Compliance: Log Analytics, Cost Management, and Encryption policies ensure cost control and security compliance.
‚úÖ Separation of Concerns: Platform and application components are clearly segmented to improve manageability and security.
