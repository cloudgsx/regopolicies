Trend in Velocity
Velocity is measured in story points completed within a sprint. The average velocity is 62.43 story points.
Over the sprints, there is variation in the number of committed and completed story points. Some sprints have a noticeable gap between committed and completed story points.
2. Comparison of Committed vs. Completed Work
ECPJAC.24.P.S54: Committed 99, Completed 68 (68.7% completion rate). Indicates that some work wasn't finished within the sprint.
ECPJAC.24.P.S55: Committed 116, Completed 73 (62.9% completion rate). Shows a higher gap between committed and completed points.
ECPJAC.24.P.S56: Committed 81, Completed 25 (30.9% completion rate). A significant drop in completed points, which may indicate blockers or inefficiencies.
ECPJAC.24.P.S1: Committed 105, Completed 74 (70.5% completion rate). Improved performance compared to previous sprints.
ECPJAC.24.P.S2: Committed 140, Completed 92 (65.7% completion rate). The team tackled more work but could not complete all of it.
ECPJAC.24.P.S3: Committed 156, Completed 105 (67.3% completion rate). This was the sprint with the highest completed work.
3. Performance Over Time
While the team's committed work (gray bars) tends to increase across sprints, the completed work (green bars) doesn't always scale proportionally.
The gap between committed and completed points varies, highlighting areas where planning and execution may need alignment.
4. Insights and Recommendations
Underestimation or Overcommitment: The consistent gap between committed and completed work suggests that the team may be overcommitting or facing unforeseen challenges that slow progress.
Sprint Planning: Refining estimation techniques during sprint planning could improve accuracy in setting achievable sprint goals.
Addressing Blockers: Sprints with a larger gap (e.g., ECPJAC.24.P.S56) may have been affected by dependencies, technical issues, or other blockers. Identifying and resolving these issues will improve performance.
Team Capacity: Understanding whether team availability or workload changed could help explain some of the variations in velocity.
Retrospective Analysis: Reviewing the reasons for missed points in each sprint will provide actionable insights.
Overall, the chart suggests steady progress but room for improvement in estimation, planning, and execution. Focusing on delivering a consistent velocity closer to the committed values will enhance predictability and efficiency. Let me know if you'd like further analysis!
