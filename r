Network Boundaries and Traffic Flow Clarification

All provider publishing and consumption traffic described in this appendix occurs over controlled, outbound HTTPS connections initiated from approved internal systems. Provider artifacts are built within BoFA-controlled CI/CD environments and uploaded to Artifactory hosted within approved BoFA infrastructure. Terraform Enterprise (both On-Prem and AWS-hosted) retrieves provider artifacts exclusively from Artifactory over secure, authenticated channels. No inbound connectivity from the internet is required, no provider artifacts are exposed publicly, and no direct traffic flows from Terraform workspaces to external provider sources. While Terraform Enterprise on AWS operates within AWS-managed infrastructure, all provider artifact flow remains governed by BoFA network controls, security policies, and access restrictions, ensuring traffic is either fully internal or traverses approved, secured BoFA–AWS trust boundaries.
