Scope of Applicability:
The IAM L0 (Identity and Access Management Level 0) process is relevant to CORP tenants

Lanes and Management Groups:
Within CORP, there are three lanes: DEV, UAT, and PROD.
These lanes fall under different management groups, which require provisioning and maintenance.

Role of IAM L0:

The IAM L0 process ensures that proper management groups are provisioned and maintained.
The IAM team handles role assignments for access control.
Admin SPM (Subscription and Permission Management) plays a role in granting access.

Identity Management:

IAM is responsible for managing identities across the entire tenant.
Any required changes to access or configuration must align with existing IAM policies.
