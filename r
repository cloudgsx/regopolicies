Hi Team,

I wanted to bring to your attention some recent changes in the Corp 3 repositories, particularly related to naming conventions. Based on the latest Terraform plan output, there are updates affecting key vault keys, load balancer modules, and identity assignmentsâ€”specifically around resource names (e.g., saeusd71148app3-key).

These changes are triggering replacements during apply, which could have implications for our deployments and access configurations. To ensure we stay aligned and avoid inconsistencies or unexpected downtime, we need to decide as a team:

Do we align all naming conventions to the new standard across environments?

Should we refactor existing infrastructure or introduce aliases to maintain backward compatibility?

Who should take ownership of reviewing and updating impacted modules?

Please review the attached screenshot for reference and reply with your input by [insert date/time], so we can align on the path forward.
