Hi Pawan,

I hope you’re well.

I wanted to have a quick chat about how we handle overtime during release periods. Over the past few weeks, there have been several instances — particularly around releases and late-day meetings — where I’ve worked beyond my scheduled hours. These are often not planned far in advance, so I haven’t always had the opportunity to flag them ahead of time.

I understand the importance of adhering to our 5 PM cutoff, and I’ll do my best to inform you in advance going forward. That said, due to the recurring nature of these extended hours, I’d like to explore whether we could formalize an approach for tracking and compensating this time.

I’d be happy to align on either:

Earning comp time at a 1.5x rate (e.g., 1 hour of overtime = 1.5 hours off), or

Accruing overtime and taking time off once a full day’s worth has been built up.

If comp time isn’t preferred, I’d also be open to discussing paid overtime as an alternative.

Ultimately, I want to support the team and our delivery goals while also ensuring there’s a balance that works for both sides. Let me know if we could find time for a quick conversation on this.

Thanks and best regards,
Roberto
