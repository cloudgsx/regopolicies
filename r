Epic Title:
Monitoring and Alarm System Implementation

Epic Description:
Implement a robust monitoring and alarm system to enhance the observability, performance, and reliability of the organization's infrastructure and applications. This project will focus on setting up monitoring for critical systems, defining alert thresholds, automating notifications, and integrating with incident management workflows.

Acceptance Criteria:
Comprehensive monitoring is set up for infrastructure, applications, and networks.
Alerts are configured with actionable thresholds to minimize noise and false positives.
All alarms are integrated with the incident management system (e.g., PagerDuty, ServiceNow).
Dashboards provide real-time visibility into system health and performance.
The system complies with the organization's security and data privacy standards.
Business Objectives:
Minimize Downtime: Enable proactive identification of potential issues before they impact users.
Improve Incident Response: Provide actionable alerts and integrate them into workflows to reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).
Enhance Observability: Deliver end-to-end visibility into system performance and application health.
Scalability and Extensibility: Ensure the solution can scale with infrastructure growth and adapt to evolving requirements.
Key Deliverables:
Monitoring solution setup (e.g., Prometheus, Azure Monitor, Datadog).
Alarm thresholds defined based on SLAs and SLOs.
Integration of alert notifications with email, Slack, and incident management tools.
Real-time dashboards for key metrics (e.g., latency, error rates, CPU/memory usage).
Documentation and training for teams.
User Stories and Tasks:
Monitoring Setup
Configure monitoring tools for infrastructure and application layers.
Subtask: Set up VM-level monitoring (CPU, Memory, Disk).
Subtask: Set up application-level monitoring (APM).
Subtask: Configure database monitoring.
Implement network monitoring for connectivity checks.
Subtask: Monitor internal VMs and inter-VNet traffic (L3 and above).
Alert Configuration
Define alerting policies for infrastructure-level metrics.
Create application-level alarms for response times and error rates.
Implement alert deduplication and noise reduction mechanisms.
Integration
Integrate alerting with incident management systems.
Subtask: Configure webhook/API integration with PagerDuty.
Subtask: Test alert workflows with end-to-end scenarios.
Connect alerting to communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams).
Dashboards
Design and implement dashboards for key stakeholders:
Subtask: Build high-level executive dashboard.
Subtask: Build detailed technical dashboard for operations teams.
Testing and Validation
Test alerts with simulated incidents.
Validate dashboards with stakeholders to ensure usefulness.
Conduct load testing to verify system scalability.
Documentation and Handover
Document the monitoring and alerting setup.
Create runbooks for incident response based on the alarm system.
Conduct training sessions for relevant teams.
Dependencies:
Network setup for connectivity testing between systems.
Access to existing incident management platforms (e.g., PagerDuty, ServiceNow).
Collaboration with application teams for defining alert thresholds.
Risks and Mitigations:
Risk	Mitigation
High volume of false positives	Implement alert deduplication and refine thresholds.
Limited team expertise in monitoring tools	Provide training sessions and workshops.
Integration delays with incident systems	Engage with integration teams early in the project.


Timeline:

Create initial alert thresholds for critical metrics.
Phase 3: Advanced Alerting, Integration, and Dashboard Creation (Week 7-10)
Define advanced alert policies, including deduplication and escalation paths.
Integrate alerting with incident management systems (e.g., PagerDuty, ServiceNow).
Build and refine dashboards for various stakeholders.
Phase 4: Testing, Documentation, and Training (Week 11-12)
Conduct end-to-end testing, including simulated incidents and alert verification.
Validate dashboards and alerts with stakeholders for feedback and adjustments.
Document monitoring and alerting setup, including runbooks and guides.
Provide training for teams on the use of monitoring tools, dashboards, and incident response workflows.
