User Story 1: Document Azure Image Creation Process
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to research and document the steps for creating images in Azure using native tooling,
so that I can establish a clear process for image creation.

Acceptance Criteria:

A step-by-step document outlining the native image creation process is created and peer-reviewed.

Documentation is validated against a test environment and updated for accuracy.

User Story 2: Evaluate Benefits of Azure Native Tooling
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to list out the advantages of leveraging Azure native tooling,
so that I can present a well-informed case for using native tools over alternatives.

Acceptance Criteria:

A pros/cons list comparing native Azure tooling to current methods is created.

The list is shared with stakeholders for feedback and agreement on direction.

User Story 3: Develop Image Testing and Validation Plan
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to develop a testing plan to validate the created images,
so that I can ensure the quality and reliability of the images.

Acceptance Criteria:

A test plan document is created that includes test cases, success metrics, and rollback plans.

The plan is used in at least one test run with results recorded.

User Story 4: Implement PoC Using Azure DevOps
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to implement a PoC using Azure DevOps,
so that I can evaluate the end-to-end image creation and deployment process.

Acceptance Criteria:

A working PoC pipeline is set up in Azure DevOps and completes without errors.

PoC includes deployment and verification of at least one image.

User Story 5: Assess Horizon Tooling Capabilities
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to analyze Horizonâ€™s capability to achieve the same objectives,
so that I can compare and evaluate alternative tooling options.

Acceptance Criteria:

A comparison document is created showing feature parity and gaps between Horizon and Azure.

Findings are reviewed with the team for a final tooling decision.

User Story 6: Review Internet Dependency and Internal Repositories
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to review internet dependency concerns and explore internal repository options,
so that I can ensure compliance and operational feasibility in restricted environments.

Acceptance Criteria:

Internet dependency matrix is compiled and reviewed with the network/security team.

Feasibility of internal image repositories is documented with alternatives suggested.

User Story 7: Align with Security Policies
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to engage with the security team (CADA) to align with security policies,
so that I can ensure compliance with internal guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:

A meeting is conducted with the security team to review image creation plans.

Any policy gaps or risks are documented and mitigation steps identified.

User Story 8: Summarize Findings and Recommendations
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to document findings and recommendations for moving forward,
so that the team has clear guidance for future implementation phases.

Acceptance Criteria:

A final report is prepared summarizing outcomes, decisions, and next steps.

The document is shared with project stakeholders and uploaded to the central repository.
