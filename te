To implement the DNS Zone setup for an App Service Environment (appserviceenvironment.net) in Terraform, we need to follow these steps:

User Story Details:

User Story: As a foundation engineer, I want to create the appserviceenvironment.net DNS Zone in the ConnHub L1 landing zone to ensure proper resolution and connectivity for the Logic App and App Service Environment.
Acceptance Criteria:
AC1: The appserviceenvironment.net DNS Zone is created and configured in the specified landing zone.
AC2: DNS records are validated to ensure proper resolution for associated services.
Definition of Done:
The DNS Zone is created in Azure.
All required DNS records are validated and functioning.
Terraform Code: Below is the Terraform code to create a DNS Zone (appserviceenvironment.net) and add necessary records.
Explanation:

The azurerm_dns_zone resource creates the DNS Zone (appserviceenvironment.net) in the specified Resource Group.
The azurerm_dns_a_record and other records (CNAME, TXT) are examples of the DNS entries needed to validate connectivity for the Logic App and App Service Environment.
Validation: After deploying the Terraform code, you can verify the DNS Zone and records using:

Azure Portal.
Azure CLI: az network dns zone show --name appserviceenvironment.net.
