1. Introduction

Identity and Access Management Level 0 (IAM L0) is a fundamental layer in the IAM hierarchy, responsible for provisioning, managing, and maintaining management groups and access configurations within the CART tenant environment. This documentation outlines the key responsibilities, scope, and processes associated with IAM L0.

2. Scope of IAM L0

2.1 Applicability

IAM L0 is only applicable to CART tenants and does not apply to CART-K and CART-2 due to differences in their infrastructure, particularly the absence of multiple lanes.

2.2 CART Tenant Lanes

IAM L0 operates within the CART environment, which is structured into three distinct lanes:

FTEV (Feature Test Environment)

UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

PROT (Production)

Each lane falls under different management groups, and IAM L0 is responsible for ensuring proper governance and access control over these groups.

3. Responsibilities of IAM L0

IAM L0 has the following key responsibilities:

3.1 Management Group Provisioning

Ensuring that all management groups are created and maintained before access provisioning.

Monitoring and maintaining the configuration of management groups within the CART lanes.

3.2 Role Assignment and Access Control

IAM L0 does not directly assign roles but supports IAM L1 by maintaining access configurations.

Works closely with IAM L1 to ensure that proper role definitions are applied across the system.

3.3 Configuration Maintenance

Ensuring that the system remains aligned with organizational policies.

Addressing future access requirements and managing changes in the IAM structure.

3.4 Integration with IAM L1

IAM L0 maintains base-level identity configurations, while IAM L1 is responsible for assigning user and application roles.

IAM L0 ensures that IAM L1 has the necessary permissions and frameworks to manage identity assignments effectively.

4. Key Entities in IAM L0

4.1 Admin SPM (Subscription and Permission Management)

Admin SPM is responsible for granting access within the tenant environment.

IAM L0 ensures that Admin SPM has the required permissions to perform role assignments at higher levels.

4.2 IAM Team

The IAM team is responsible for managing identities across the entire CART tenant.

Works with IAM L1 to facilitate role assignments and ensure compliance.

5. Conclusion

IAM L0 plays a foundational role in identity and access management by provisioning and maintaining management groups, ensuring that IAM L1 has the necessary configurations for effective role assignments. By adhering to IAM L0 processes, organizations can streamline identity governance, enhance security, and maintain a structured access control model.
