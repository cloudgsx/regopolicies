Goal

This document outlines the implementation details and execution flow for the Security Key Vault Level 2 Landing Zone within the NextGen environment.

Strategic Fit

Azure Key Vault addresses critical security and management needs, including:

Secrets Management: Securely storing tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other sensitive data.

Key Management: Generating and managing encryption keys securely.

Certificate Management: Managing public and private certificates for Azure and integrated resources.

Azure Key Vault offers two service tiers:

Standard: Software-based key encryption.

Premium: Hardware Security Module (HSM)-based key encryption.

Overview

The Security Key Vault Level 1 and Level 2 templates facilitate Key Vault resource setup for Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) enablement.

Key Vault provisioning occurs post Connectivity L1 and L2 Landing Zone resource creation, leveraging subnet IDs from the Connectivity Infrastructure VNet to establish private endpoints.

Prerequisites

Contributor-level permissions at cross-subscription level for Azure provisioning.

Dedicated Terraform Enterprise (TFE) workspace.

TFE backend setup.

GIS subscription ID for Log Analytics Workspace.

Architecture Summary

The architecture spans multiple landing zones interconnected securely via Azure private links, private endpoints, and ExpressRoute circuits:

Platform Landing Zone

Hub Resource Group: Manages core networking with ExpressRoute, gateway subnets, and private endpoints.

Infra Resource Group: Manages infrastructure subnets, storage accounts, and private endpoints.

FinOps Resource Group: Manages financial operations, dashboards, cost alerts, and analytics.

Platform Key Vault Resource Group: Dedicated key management.

Application Landing Zone

Foundational Platform Resource Group: Contains storage, key vault, disk encryption, and network flow log management.

User Resource Group: Hosts business and web subnets, virtual machines/scales sets, load balancers, and network security.

GIS Tenant

Centralized monitoring and analytics with Log Analytics workspace, clusters, and alerts.
