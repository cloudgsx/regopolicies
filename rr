As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to automatically generate and update a structured deployment plan in Confluence using information from JIRA release tickets,
so that I can reduce manual effort, ensure consistency, and improve the accuracy of our release documentation.

üìã Requirements
Pull JIRA issue data based on specific filters (e.g., project = ECPAWS, status = "Ready to Release").

Extract relevant fields from JIRA:

Issue Key, Summary, Assignee, Labels (e.g., Urgent)

Custom fields: MOJITO ID, Code Review Status, Deployment Steps, Related PR links

Generate a formatted Confluence table (similar to the current deployment plan layout).

Update or overwrite a specific Confluence page (e.g., "Release Implementation Plan") on a scheduled or manual trigger.

Allow flexibility to select which release or ticket set to generate a plan for.

Securely authenticate to JIRA and Confluence using personal access tokens (PATs) or OAuth.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
#	Description	Must Have / Nice to Have
1	A script or tool pulls data from JIRA and posts to Confluence	Must Have
2	Deployment plan in Confluence includes all required fields in the correct column layout	Must Have
3	Urgent tickets are clearly marked and highlighted	Must Have
4	The automation runs on demand and/or on a schedule (e.g., via GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)	Nice to Have
5	Can be configured to filter by JIRA label, status, or sprint	Must Have
6	Supports version control or backup of Confluence page before update	Nice to Have
7	Admin users can override or edit the content manually after automation runs	Must Have

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes
Use the following APIs:

JIRA REST API

Confluence REST API

Consider using Python with jira and atlassian-python-api libraries.

Deployment steps and code review statuses might come from custom fields (needs JIRA admin to confirm field IDs).

Use Confluence table markup or HTML to format the content cleanly.





Option 1: Use Atlassian Automation + Smart Links (Best for Simplicity)
Tool Used: JIRA Automation + Smart Confluence Macros

Approach:

Set up a JIRA filter that captures all release tickets (e.g., label = "release").

Use JIRA Automation to send updates to Confluence when tickets transition to a release-ready status.

Use Smart Links or Excerpt macros to display structured ticket data in Confluence pages.

Pros:

No coding needed.

Real-time updates as tickets move.

Cons:

Less customizable in terms of layout.
