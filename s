Summary
Establish a branching strategy to streamline the code management process across UAT, Corp-Dev, Corp-UAT, and Corp-Prod environments. This ensures efficient collaboration, testing, and deployment while maintaining code quality and traceability.

Description
As a [team role, e.g., "DevOps Engineer" or "Development Team"],
I want to implement a branching strategy to manage the code flow for UAT, Corp-Dev, Corp-UAT, and Corp-Prod environments,
So that I can ensure smooth integration, testing, and production deployments with minimal conflicts and high traceability.

Acceptance Criteria
Main Branch Setup

 The main branch is designated for stable, production-ready code.
 All releases to production are tagged and deployed from the main branch.
Develop Branch Setup

 The develop branch is designated for integration of features and bug fixes.
 All feature and bugfix branches merge into develop via PRs.
 The develop branch reflects the Corp-Dev environment.
Release Branches

 A release/uat branch is created for UAT testing and deployments, branched from develop.
 A release/corp-uat branch is created for corporate validation, branched from release/uat.
 A release/corp-prod branch is created for final pre-production testing, branched from release/corp-uat.
Branching and Merging Rules

 All code merges into develop or main must follow a PR review process.
 Hotfixes are branched from main and merged into both main and develop to ensure synchronization.
 Changes in release branches are merged back into develop and higher-level release branches as appropriate.
Versioning and Tagging

 Semantic versioning is applied to the main branch (e.g., v1.0.0 for production releases).
 Pre-release identifiers (e.g., v1.0.0-uat, v1.0.0-corp-uat) are used for release branches.
Testing and Validation

 Ensure deployment and validation processes are aligned with the branching strategy.
 All release branches pass testing criteria before merging upstream.
Tasks
Branch Creation and Naming Conventions

 Create the main, develop, and release branches (release/uat, release/corp-uat, release/corp-prod).
 Establish naming conventions for feature, bugfix, and hotfix branches.
Merging Workflow Setup

 Define and document the merging flow from feature/bugfix branches to develop and main.
 Set up PR templates and guidelines for code review.
Versioning and Tagging

 Configure versioning rules for main and release branches.
 Document the tagging process for production releases and pre-releases.
Documentation and Training

 Document the branching strategy and share it with the team.
 Conduct a walkthrough session to explain the workflow.
CI/CD Pipeline Alignment

 Update CI/CD pipelines to align with the new branching strategy for deployments to the respective environments.
