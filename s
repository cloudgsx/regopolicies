 it should take 5–15 minutes per story under normal conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the steps and estimated time:

Review Existing Story (1–2 minutes)

Read the current story and identify gaps in clarity, structure, or missing information.
Rewrite the Title and Description (2–3 minutes)

Update the title to make it concise and descriptive.
Refine the description to follow the "As a [user role], I want [feature], so that [value]" format.
Define or Refine Acceptance Criteria (3–5 minutes)

Add measurable, testable, and clear acceptance criteria.
Ensure they align with the story's intent and cover necessary testing and documentation.
Update Definition of Ready (DoR) (2–3 minutes)

List preconditions that must be met for the story to begin.
This step is often quick if your team uses a standard DoR template.
Update Definition of Done (DoD) (2–3 minutes)

Clearly define the criteria for considering the story complete.
Include testing, documentation, and code review requirements.
Final Review (1–2 minutes)

Verify that the story now follows Scrum principles.
Ensure alignment with team processes and goals.
