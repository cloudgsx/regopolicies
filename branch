Main Branches Only:

Use only two primary branches: main (or master) and develop.
main: Always represents the stable, production-ready code.
develop: Represents the ongoing development. New features and bug fixes are merged here.
Feature Branches:

Create short-lived branches for features or fixes. Name them descriptively, such as feature-login or bugfix-typo.
Merge them back into develop when completed and tested.
Release Branches (Optional):

If releases need stabilization before deployment, create temporary release branches (release-1.0) to freeze features and focus on final testing and bug fixes.
Hotfixes:

For urgent production bugs, create a hotfix branch directly from main. Once fixed, merge the hotfix into both main and develop.
Tagging:

Tag releases on the main branch (e.g., v1.0.0) for clarity.
