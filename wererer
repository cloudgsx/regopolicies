As an Azure Infrastructure Engineer, I want to investigate and find a solution to the Terraform error "The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state" when provisioning a VM in Azure, so that I can ensure successful and consistent provisioning without failures.

Problem Statement
Terraform fails to provision a VM in Azure with the following error message:

"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state: 'Failed'."
The failure is related to resource identity operations and a conflict error indicating that the resource already exists or a pending delete operation is causing the failure.
Tasks
Investigate the root cause

Check Azure Activity Logs and Terraform state to identify conflicts.
Verify if a previous delete operation is still pending.
Confirm if the resource identity permissions are correctly configured.
Examine Azure Resource Manager (ARM) logs for additional failure insights.
Reproduce the Issue

Attempt to provision the same VM using Terraform in a controlled environment.
Monitor logs and identify any patterns related to the error.
Identify Possible Solutions

Ensure proper cleanup of orphaned resources before provisioning.
Adjust Terraform configurations to avoid conflicts.
Implement a retry mechanism for provisioning attempts.
Check for dependency issues related to identity operations.
Implement and Validate Fixes

Apply the identified solutions and test VM provisioning.
Verify the resolution across multiple test runs.
Update Terraform scripts if necessary to prevent similar issues.
Document Findings and Update Runbooks

Summarize the issue, root cause, and the applied fix.
Update Terraform best practices documentation.
Share learnings with the team for future prevention.
Acceptance Criteria
 The root cause of the error is identified and documented.
 A validated solution is implemented and tested successfully.
 Terraform successfully provisions the VM without encountering the terminal provisioning error.
 Documentation and Terraform scripts are updated with the best practices to prevent recurrence.
