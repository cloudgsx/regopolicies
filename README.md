T-24h filter check → Prevents last-minute surprises by chasing ownership and making sure all tickets are assigned. Best practice: early accountability check.

Start of window dashboard → Having a shared “single source of truth” dashboard avoids hallway syncs and conflicting spreadsheets. Best practice: shared visibility.

Hourly check on “Updated” → Catching stuck tickets before they block a cutover is critical. Best practice: proactive monitoring instead of firefighting.

Pre-cutover empty “In flight” filter → Guarantees nothing is half-done when you deploy. Best practice: ensuring stability at go/no-go time.

Post-deploy “Done” filter + export → Confirms closure and leaves an audit trail for RCA or compliance. Best practice: release accountability and traceability.
