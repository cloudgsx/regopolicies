Creating a process for an Agile team to manage work during periods like Christmas, including a change freeze and assigning backup personnel for PR reviews and merges, involves a few key steps:

1. Define the Change Freeze Period
Set Dates: Clearly define the start and end dates of the change freeze.
Scope: Specify what types of changes are frozen (e.g., only production deployments) and exceptions (e.g., critical fixes).
2. Pre-Freeze Preparations
Plan Backlog Items: Ensure priority work is completed or queued before the freeze.
Communicate Deadlines: Share clear deadlines for submitting changes that must go live before the freeze.
Schedule Reviews: Encourage teams to prioritize code reviews and merges ahead of the freeze period.
3. Backup Reviewer Assignment
Identify Alternates: Assign team members as backup reviewers for PRs in the absence of primary owners.
Skills Matching: Ensure the backups are familiar with the codebase and domain to provide effective reviews.
Access: Verify that backups have the necessary permissions to review and merge PRs.
4. Minimal Operations During the Freeze
Critical Changes Only: Establish guidelines for handling emergencies (e.g., production bugs).
Dedicated On-Call Team: Assign a lightweight, on-call team for urgent situations.
Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for how to handle exceptions and escalation paths.
5. PR Handling Process
Define Clear Criteria: Backup reviewers should follow predefined guidelines to approve or reject PRs (e.g., coding standards, test coverage).
Testing: Emphasize automated testing and CI pipelines to validate changes before merging.
Communication: Use tools (like Slack or MS Teams) to maintain visibility on PRs being reviewed and merged.
6. Post-Freeze Activities
Gradual Rollouts: After the freeze, re-enable changes cautiously, starting with lower-risk deployments.
Retrospective: Conduct a retrospective to identify improvements for the next freeze period.
Acknowledgment: Appreciate team members who contributed during the freeze.
This approach ensures the team maintains stability during holidays while enabling work continuity and responsiveness to urgent needs.
