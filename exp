1. Network Security Group (NSG) Rules Validation
This sample JSON represents a Terraform plan for an Azure Network Security Group. You could test for rules like blocking inbound traffic from specific IP ranges or ensuring critical ports (e.g., SSH, RDP) are restricted.+

Key Scenarios to Test:
Ensure destination_port_range: 22 (SSH) allows only specific IPs, not 0.0.0.0/0.
Verify that all inbound traffic rules with Allow access include source restrictions.

2. Storage Account Configuration Validation
This JSON represents a Terraform plan for an Azure Storage Account. The goal is to validate settings like secure transfer being enabled and public access being restricted.

Key Scenarios to Test:
Verify enable_https_traffic_only is set to true for secure communication.
Ensure allow_blob_public_access is false to prevent public exposure.
Validate network_rules.default_action is Deny unless explicitly required.

3. Azure Virtual Machine Settings Validation
This JSON represents a Terraform plan for an Azure Virtual Machine. The goal is to validate VM-related configurations, such as disk encryption, VM size, and managed identity presence.

Key Scenarios to Test:
Ensure os_profile_linux_config.disable_password_authentication is true for SSH key authentication only.
Validate that the OS disk is encrypted (encryption_settings.enabled is true).
Check that the VM has a system-assigned managed identity (identity.type is SystemAssigned).

4. App Service Validation
This JSON represents an Azure App Service. It checks for proper authentication settings, secure protocols, and resource scaling configurations.

Key Scenarios to Test:
Verify https_only is set to true to enforce secure protocols.
Ensure auth_settings.require_authentication is true for application access.
Validate min_tls_version is at least 1.2 for secure communication.


5. Key Vault Access Policy Validation
This JSON represents an Azure Key Vault with access policies. The goal is to validate access restrictions and ensure no overly permissive access.

Key Scenarios to Test:
Ensure no Delete permissions are granted unnecessarily for keys or secrets.
Validate that all access policies are scoped to specific object IDs.


This .rego file includes rules for checking network security rules, storage accounts, virtual machines, app services, and key vault access policies.
Explanation of the Rego File
Deny Rules:

Each deny rule checks a specific type of Azure resource (e.g., Network Security Groups, Storage Accounts).
If a violation is found, it adds a message describing the violation.
Network Security Group Rules:

Ensures that SSH (port 22) is not open to the world (0.0.0.0/0).
Storage Account Rules:

Verifies that HTTPS traffic is enforced (enable_https_traffic_only is true).
Ensures public blob access is not allowed (allow_blob_public_access is false).
Validates that the minimum TLS version is TLS1_2.
Virtual Machine Rules:

Ensures password authentication is disabled (disable_password_authentication is true).
Checks that OS disk encryption is enabled.
Validates that a system-assigned managed identity is present.
App Service Rules:

Checks that HTTPS is enforced.
Ensures authentication is required.
Verifies that the minimum TLS version is at least 1.2.
Key Vault Rules:

Flags any access policies that allow Delete permissions for keys or secrets.
