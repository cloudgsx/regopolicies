Azure Infrastructure Diagram Overview

High-Level Architecture

The Azure infrastructure diagram presents a structured view of various Azure services and components, clearly segmented into three main zones:

GIS Zone

Platform Landing Zone

Application Landing Zone

1. GIS Zone (Tenant-specific)

This zone handles log analytics, storage, security, and monitoring.

Resource Group: CSOM Resource Group

Log Analytics Workspace

Log Analytics Cluster

Storage Account

Key Vault (Securely integrated)

Alerts for monitoring

2. Platform Landing Zone

This is a central zone connecting various subnets and resources:

ExpressRoute Connectivity:

Express Route Circuit is located within the Hub Resource Group to enable secure connectivity.

The Express Route Gateway connects via a Public IP and enables private endpoint connections.

Financial Operations:

Fin Ops Resource Group

Cost Alerts

Dashboards and Queries

Monitoring Alerts

Infrastructure Resources:

Dedicated resource groups for managing infrastructure networking and storage:

Infra Resource Group

Infra VNET:

Infra Subnet with NSG protection

Private Endpoints for secure communication

Storage Account for network flow logs

Platform Key Vault secured separately for credentials management.

Networking and DNS:

Azure Private DNS Zone for secure internal DNS resolution.

Established links and peering with application-specific VNets.

3. Application Landing Zone

This zone hosts application-specific resources segmented into foundational and user-specific groups:

Foundational Platform Resource Group:

Storage Account

Data Subnet with Private Endpoints and NSG

Key Vault for secure key management

Disk Encryption Set

Network Flow Logs

User Resource Group:

Application VNET divided into:

Business Subnet:

VM Scale Sets

NSG secured

Web Subnet:

Load Balancer

NSG secured

Peered connectivity to central Private DNS for seamless integration and internal communication.

Security & Monitoring

Each subnet is secured with Network Security Groups (NSG).

Use of Key Vault for centralized secrets and key management across zones.

Integration of Azure Defender for threat detection and prevention.

Connectivity

Secure connectivity across zones managed through ExpressRoute, Private Link Scopes, and peered VNets.

Network flow logging and alerts in place for proactive monitoring.
