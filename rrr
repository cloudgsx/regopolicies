As a DevOps engineer,
I want to spin up an EC2 instance in a lab environment that can perform statefile surgery,
so that I can validate infrastructure documentation and ensure platform readiness.

Acceptance Criteria:

An EC2 instance can be provisioned in the lab environment.

The EC2 instance is configured to perform statefile surgery operations successfully.

Documentation for how to use the EC2 instance is created and reviewed.

Documentation is validated by running statefile surgery tasks in the lab environment.

Success criteria include: reproducibility, error-free execution, and alignment with AWS best practices.

Definition of Done (DoD):

EC2 instance is deployed in lab and accessible.

Statefile surgery can be performed and demonstrated.

Documentation is published and validated.

Peer review is completed and approved.
