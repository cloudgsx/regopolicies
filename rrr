Summary/Context:

A Jenkins build is failing due to an invalid solidateValueSetId, related to lack of proper TFE (Terraform Enterprise) token access.

Investigations revealed that the IaC pipeline token does not have access to the QA team project (71148_ECP_QA_Team) in the TFE-UAT environment.

Miguel confirmed via email that the project was never set up for IaC pipeline access due to a missing automation team association.

A dependency on TFE team response was created, and discussion is ongoing to clarify if the current access suffices or if additional setup/support tickets are needed.

Hi John,

Thank you for your response.

To clarify, the current issue weâ€™re facing is with Jenkins builds failing due to missing/invalid TFE token access for the QA project (71148_ECP_QA_Team) in TFE-UAT. As identified by Miguel, this project was not set up with the necessary automation team in TFE, and therefore the IaC pipeline token does not have the required permissions.

The expectation is to enable the IaC pipeline to access this QA project for deploying infrastructure as part of our CI/CD automation. We're not seeking access beyond this specific scope, but just ensuring the current pipeline token can authenticate and operate within the project context.

Please let us know if a support ticket needs to be raised to complete the automation team mapping or any additional steps needed from our side to resolve this.

Thanks and Regards,
