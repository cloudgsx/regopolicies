AC1: Ensuring CI/CD Pipeline Supports CORP Build-Out
Given that the tf_azr_lz_connhub_2 landing zone template must support CORP build-out,
When the CI/CD pipeline executes deployment workflows,
Then the pipeline should successfully integrate with the required automation components to ensure seamless deployment.

AC2: Standardized Input Files for CORP Environments
Given that structured input files are required for CORP/DEV and CORP/UAT deployments,
When the engineering team defines and structures these files,
Then they should be:
Clearly documented within tf_azr_lz_connhub_12 following standard naming conventions.
Properly configured to align with CORP build requirements and prevent inconsistencies.
Ready for use in automated deployment processes.

AC3: Ensuring Deployment Process Completes Successfully with Full Integration
Given that the deployment process must ensure proper integration across CORP environments,
When a deployment is triggered,
Then it should:
Complete successfully with all required infrastructure components provisioned as per the defined configuration.
Ensure seamless integration with dependent services and resources.
Prevent failures caused by misconfigurations or missing dependencies.
