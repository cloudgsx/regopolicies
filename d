Double-checking should be a must – Just like in software development where pull requests require reviews, validating critical information (such as infrastructure details) should be encouraged, not discouraged. A second pair of eyes can prevent costly mistakes.

Divide and conquer – Each team has its own area of expertise and is responsible for maintaining and managing its environment. Relying solely on one person's knowledge within our team is risky when we have dedicated experts in other teams who can provide accurate and up-to-date information.

Yes, we need to improve our review process – If last-minute corrections or discrepancies keep arising, it’s a sign that our review process needs improvement. A structured approach—like a preflight check forum—would ensure we are proactively identifying and fixing issues rather than reacting under pressure.

No one should be shamed for asking questions – Open communication and cross-team collaboration should be encouraged. Verifying information should never be seen as “bothering another team” but rather as a responsible and professional approach to ensuring smooth releases.
