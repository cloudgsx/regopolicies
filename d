Title:
Document use cases for Network Watcher and share with ECPOPS team

Description:
As an Engineer,
I need to create use cases for Azure Network Watcher and document them in the engineering Confluence page,
so that the ECPOPS team can effectively reference and use the documentation for operations and troubleshooting.

Acceptance Criteria:
Use cases for Azure Network Watcher are created and documented, covering:
Common monitoring scenarios.
Troubleshooting processes.
Steps for enabling and configuring Network Watcher features.
Documentation is reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.
Documentation is shared with the ECPOPS team and made available in the engineering Confluence page.
Confirmation from ECPOPS team that they have received and can access the documentation.
Definition of Ready:
Access to relevant Azure resources and Network Watcher configurations.
Existing reference material or examples (if available).
Alignment on scope and use cases to be documented (confirmed with stakeholders or team leads).
Definition of Done:
All required use cases are documented in the Confluence page.
The documentation includes clear examples, steps, and screenshots (if applicable).
Documentation is reviewed and approved by peers or team leads.
Handover to ECPOPS team is complete, and they confirm receipt.
Test Scope:
No Testing Required: This is a documentation task with no functional testing impact.
Justification: The work involves creating documentation for operational use and does not impact performance or functionality.
Risks:
Incomplete Documentation: Missing critical use cases could limit the usefulness of the documentation.
Mitigation: Review the use cases with stakeholders before finalizing.
Access Issues: Lack of access to required resources or configurations could delay documentation.
Mitigation: Request access during the sprint planning phase.
Misalignment with ECPOPS Expectations: Documentation might not meet the operational needs of the ECPOPS team.
Mitigation: Confirm expectations and requirements with the ECPOPS team early.
