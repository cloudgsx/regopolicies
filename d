pike: Investigate Terraform Codebase for Standardization Opportunities

Story Type: Spike

Description:

This spike is to investigate the existing Terraform codebase across CPPE to assess opportunities for standardizing repetitive code and creating reusable modules.
The objective is to determine if it's worthwhile to proceed with refactoring efforts and to understand current repository distribution and access management considerations.

Goals:

Review existing Terraform repositories under CPPE (~200+ repos).

Identify common patterns or repetitive code that can be modularized.

Evaluate feasibility and potential impact of standardization.

Understand current repository structure and group ownerships.

Investigate how access and permissions are currently managed if repos are split across multiple groups.

Sync with existing initiatives or teams already reviewing this (as mentioned by Pawan).

Deliverables:

Summary of findings

Recommendations for next steps (e.g., proceed with blueprint/module creation)

Risks or blockers (e.g., access/permission complexities)
