AC1: CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Terraform Infrastructure
Given that the CI/CD pipeline is updated with the required automation components,
When deployment workflows are executed,
Then the pipeline should correctly utilize the integrated automation components to execute deployments without errors.

AC2: Input File Definitions for CORP Environments
Given that a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is in place,
When the input files for CORP/dev and CORP/uat environments are reviewed,
Then the input files should be well-structured, clearly identifiable, and defined within tf_azr_lz_security_keyvaults_11.

AC3: Deployment Process Validation
Given that the deployment process follows the defined infrastructure provisioning standards,
When the deployment is initiated,
Then the system should ensure the deployment completes successfully with all required components provisioned as per configuration.
