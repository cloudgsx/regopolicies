An Azure Landing Zone is a set of pre-configured guidelines, best practices, and resources that help organizations set up a secure, scalable, and well-managed Azure environment. It serves as a foundation for cloud adoption, ensuring that workloads are deployed in a consistent and governed manner.

üîπ Key Aspects of an Azure Landing Zone
Governance & Compliance ‚Äì Implements policies, security controls, and compliance standards.
Networking ‚Äì Sets up Virtual Networks (VNets), Subnets, and connectivity (ExpressRoute, VPN).
Identity & Access Management (IAM) ‚Äì Defines role-based access control (RBAC) and integrates with Azure Active Directory (AAD).
Security ‚Äì Implements Azure Security Center, encryption, and monitoring tools.
Resource Organization ‚Äì Establishes management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups for structured cloud environments.
Monitoring & Logging ‚Äì Uses Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Sentinel for insights and security analysis.
Scalability & Cost Management ‚Äì Ensures cost control through budgets, tagging strategies, and reserved instances.
üîπ Types of Azure Landing Zones
Azure offers different types of landing zones based on organizational needs:

Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone ‚Äì Best for large organizations with a structured cloud strategy.
CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework) Ready Landing Zone ‚Äì Aligns with Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Adoption Framework.
Custom Landing Zones ‚Äì Tailored to specific business needs and regulatory requirements.
üîπ Benefits of Azure Landing Zones
‚úÖ Faster Cloud Adoption ‚Äì Reduces the time needed to set up Azure environments.
‚úÖ Security & Compliance ‚Äì Implements Zero Trust principles for a secure cloud setup.
‚úÖ Operational Excellence ‚Äì Automates deployments with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Terraform or Bicep.
‚úÖ Scalability & Cost Optimization ‚Äì Prepares the environment for future expansion without over-provisioning.



The diagram outlines the Landing Zone Order of Execution for creating Azure Landing Zones using Terraform. It is divided into two main sections:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Platform Landing Zones (Core Infrastructure Setup)
This section defines the foundational cloud environment, including role-based access control (RBAC), networking, security policies, and key vaults:

Organization & IAM Setup:
Creates management groups, role definitions, and role assignments for identity and access management.
Implements Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for eligible role assignments.
Governance & Security:
Policy L1: Defines Azure Policy Assignments to enforce compliance.
FinOps L1: Sets up cost management, monitoring, and alerts.
Networking & Connectivity:
Connectivity Hub L1 & L2: Establishes Private DNS, Express Route Gateway, VNET Peering, and NSGs.
Key Vault & Resource Locks:
Key Vault L1 & L2: Manages encryption keys and storage for platform security.
Operations L1: Implements resource locks to protect key infrastructure.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Landing Zones (User Infrastructure Deployment)
This section focuses on setting up environments for application teams:

Application L1:
Assigns resource groups and role permissions for app teams.
Creates VNET peering between application landing zones if needed.
Application L2:
Deploys Key Vaults, Private DNS, and networking components for applications.
Ensures encryption and security compliance using Terraform-managed infrastructure.
User Landing Zones (L3):
Hosts approved user resources deployed using Terraform modules.
