To update the story to align with Scrum principles, we need to ensure the following elements are clearly defined and refined:

1. Story Title
Keep the title clear, concise, and actionable.

Example:
Attach Empty VM Disk to VM in App L3 Landing Zone

2. Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria should follow the INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable). They need to be precise and measurable.

Updated Acceptance Criteria:

An empty VM disk is created and attached to the VM as part of the landing zone deployment.
Documentation updates include:
Updated design documents.
Updated repository README file.
Updated or newly created Confluence pages.
Testing artifacts (if deferred) should have an identified owner and plan for future execution.
Clear rollback plan for deployment failures.
3. Story Description
Provide context for the story and link it to user needs or business value.

Updated Description:
As a developer, I need to attach an empty VM disk to a VM in the App L3 Landing Zone to ensure proper allocation of storage resources during deployment, supporting operational requirements and system scalability.

4. Definition of Ready
Clearly specify the prerequisites for the story to be considered ready for development.

Updated Definition of Ready:

All necessary inputs and dependencies are documented.
Acceptance criteria are approved by the Product Owner.
Necessary access permissions for environments are granted.
Dependencies with other modules (if any) are identified and communicated.
5. Definition of Done
Ensure the definition of done aligns with quality and completeness.

Updated Definition of Done:

Code changes are merged, and the pipeline is green.
Acceptance criteria are met.
All relevant documentation is updated.
Story has passed code review and peer review.
Deployment tested in the staging environment (or deferred with a clear timeline).
6. Test Plan
Even if testing is deferred, ensure a clear plan is outlined.

Updated Test Plan:

Identify the specific test cases to validate the VM disk creation and attachment.
Define the manual or automated tests and assign owners.
Include rollback validation steps in the test plan.
7. Story Points
Scrum principles emphasize team consensus in estimating effort. Ensure the story points are agreed upon during sprint planning.

Updated Story Format:
