Title:
Update Storage-Queue Module for Version Bump and Control Evidencing

Description:
As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to update the storage-queue module to bump its version for the business use case of control evidencing,
so that the latest horizon library is utilized and the module is aligned with current standards.

Acceptance Criteria:

AC1: Publish the storage-queue module with the given instructions.
AC2: Ensure the relevant documentation is updated, including:
Design document changes (as applicable).
Repository README file updates (as applicable).
Updates or creation of Confluence pages for tracking (as applicable).
Definition of Ready (DoR):

Dependencies and impacted items identified.
Access to required resources confirmed (e.g., module, documentation tools).
Code repository and Jenkins configuration ready for updates.
Definition of Done (DoD):

Storage-queue module version is updated successfully in the repository.
Jenkins file is updated for the module version and CI/CD repository.
Testing confirms module functionality with the new version.
All related documentation is reviewed and updated (design documents, README files, Confluence pages).
Required approvals are obtained from stakeholders.
Tasks:

Update the storage-queue module to bump its version.
Document the version history and updates in the README file.
Update Jenkins files for module version and CI/CD repository configuration (TBD).
Validate the module updates in a test environment.
Ensure applicable updates to design documents and Confluence pages.
Dependencies:

Access to the latest horizon library.
Jenkins setup for storage-queue module updates.
Risks:

Potential misalignment in version history leading to deployment delays.
Missing documentation updates could impact compliance and clarity.
Deliverables:

Additional Notes:

The module should remain free from configuration changes unrelated to the version bump.
Ensure all updates align with control evidencing requirements.
