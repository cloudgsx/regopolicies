High-Level Architecture

The Azure infrastructure diagram presents a structured view of various Azure services and components, clearly segmented into three main zones:

GIS Zone

Platform Landing Zone

Application Landing Zone

1. GIS Zone (Tenant-specific)

This zone handles log analytics, storage, security, and monitoring.

Resource Group: CSOM Resource Group

Log Analytics Workspace

Log Analytics Cluster

Storage Account

Key Vault (Securely integrated)

Alerts for monitoring

Connections:

Log Analytics Workspace and Cluster feed logs into the Storage Account.

The Storage Account securely integrates with Key Vault for credential and secret management.

2. Platform Landing Zone

This is a central zone connecting various subnets and resources:

ExpressRoute Connectivity:

Express Route Circuit in Hub Resource Group connects via an Express Route Gateway with a Public IP for external connectivity.

Gateway Subnet connects securely to Hub Subnet and Infra Subnet through Private Endpoints.

Financial Operations:

Fin Ops Resource Group

Receives and generates cost alerts, dashboards, and queries for monitoring financial data.

Integrated monitoring alerts provide proactive notification.

Infrastructure Resources:

Infra Resource Group

Infra VNET:

Infra Subnet has secure Private Endpoints connected to the Storage Account.

Storage Account captures Network Flow Logs, feeding into the Platform Key Vault for secure credential management.

Networking and DNS:

Azure Private DNS Zones provide secure internal DNS resolution for resources within Platform and Application Landing Zones.

Private Link Scopes and peerings connect central DNS to the Application-specific VNets.

3. Application Landing Zone

This zone hosts application-specific resources segmented into foundational and user-specific groups:

Foundational Platform Resource Group:

Storage Account connects via Private Endpoints to the Data Subnet, securely managed with NSGs.

Key Vault securely stores encryption keys linked to Disk Encryption Set and Network Flow Logs.

User Resource Group:

Application VNET:

Business Subnet:

Hosts VM Scale Sets protected by NSG.

Web Subnet:

Connected through a Load Balancer protected by NSG.

Peer connection to central Private DNS enables internal name resolution, facilitating seamless communication with Platform Zone.

Security & Monitoring

Subnets secured by Network Security Groups (NSGs).

Centralized management of secrets and keys via Key Vault.

Azure Defender integration ensures continuous threat detection and protection.

Connectivity

Connectivity managed via ExpressRoute for secure, private network communications.

Private Link Scopes and VNets peering ensure secure internal traffic flow.

Network Flow Logging integrated with Storage Accounts provides detailed monitoring.
