OPA Policy Development:

Create .rego files for KeyVault, DNS, Networking, Kubernetes (Azure and AWS), and Containers to enforce access control and compliance.
Mock Scenarios:

Design and test scenarios for valid and invalid actions to validate .rego files.
Policy Validation:

Test policies locally using OPA tools and validate in staging environments.
Integrate policies into CI/CD pipelines for automated compliance checks.
Documentation:

Document each policy's purpose, examples, and test results in a Confluence page.
Integration and Collaboration:

Successfully integrate policies into CI/CD pipelines.
Policies reviewed and approved by security, infrastructure, and DevOps teams before production deployment.


User Story
Title: Develop and Validate OPA Policies for KeyVault, DNS, Networking, Kubernetes, and Containers

Description:
As a DevOps engineer, I need to write and validate OPA policies for access control, compliance, and configuration validation for KeyVault, DNS, Networking, Kubernetes (Azure and AWS), and containers, to ensure secure and compliant infrastructure and workload management.

Acceptance Criteria
OPA Policy Development:

.rego files are created for the following use cases:
KeyVault: Policies to enforce role-based access to secrets, ensuring only authorized roles can retrieve or update secrets.
DNS: Policies to restrict unauthorized changes to DNS records (e.g., updating zones, records).
Networking: Policies to validate:
Security group rules.
Firewall configurations for compliance with organizational standards.
No overly permissive network access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 in ingress or egress rules).
Kubernetes: Policies to enforce:
Namespace isolation.
Role-based access controls (RBAC).
Resource quotas (CPU, memory).
Pod security standards.
Containers: Policies to ensure:
Only trusted, signed container images are deployed.
Containers meet organization-defined security baselines.
Mock Scenarios:

Mock scenarios are created and tested for each .rego file:
KeyVault: Test both valid and invalid access attempts based on roles.
DNS: Test policy enforcement for unauthorized updates to records.
Networking: Test validation against improper security group configurations.
Kubernetes: Test enforcement of RBAC, namespace, and resource policies.
Containers: Test compliance for container images with non-compliant configurations.
Mock tests show clear pass/fail results for policy compliance.
Policy Validation:

Policies are tested using:
Local OPA tools like conftest for .rego evaluation.
Staging environments to validate integration with infrastructure.
All policies are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated validation during deployments.
Documentation:

Each .rego file is documented with:
Policy purpose.
Example configurations (both compliant and non-compliant).
Steps for extending or customizing policies.
Testing results for mock scenarios are documented in a Confluence page, along with screenshots or logs.
Integration with CI/CD:

OPA policies are successfully integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
Any configuration or workload deployment that violates the policies is blocked automatically with meaningful error messages for developers.
Collaboration:

All policies are reviewed by security, infrastructure, and DevOps teams before deployment.
Tasks
Policy Development:

Write .rego files for:
KeyVault: Role-based access.
DNS: Zone and record modifications.
Networking: Security group/firewall validation.
Kubernetes: Namespace isolation, RBAC, resource quotas, and pod security.
Containers: Trusted images and compliance baselines.
Mock Scenario Testing:

Create test cases for valid and invalid actions (e.g., unauthorized access to KeyVault, misconfigured security groups).
Validate .rego files locally using OPA CLI or conftest.
CI/CD Integration:

Integrate .rego validation into the existing CI/CD pipelines.
Block non-compliant changes during automated deployments.
Documentation:

Write clear documentation for each .rego file.
Include mock test results and steps for reproducing them.
Create a Confluence page to centralize documentation.
Policy Review:

Schedule cross-team review sessions (security, DevOps, and infrastructure teams) to validate the policies.
Staging and Production Deployment:

Deploy policies in a staging environment for further validation.
Once validated, apply policies in production and monitor logs for enforcement outcomes.
Dependencies
Access to:
Infrastructure configurations (KeyVault, DNS, Networking, Kubernetes).
CI/CD pipelines for integration.
Defined security baselines and compliance standards (e.g., company or regulatory requirements).
Collaboration with the security and infrastructure teams.
Risks
Overly restrictive policies may block legitimate actions.
Misconfigured .rego files could lead to gaps in policy enforcement.
Lack of coverage for edge cases in mock scenarios may lead to undetected compliance violations.
Deliverables
.rego files for KeyVault, DNS, Networking, Kubernetes, and Containers.
Mock scenarios and test results.
Documentation covering:
Policy details and examples.
Mock case results.
CI/CD integration steps.
Policies reviewed, validated, and deployed in production.
