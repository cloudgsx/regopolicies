AC1: Terraform Enterprise Configuration
The Terraform Enterprise (TFE) instance is configured for production workloads.
Required workspaces and variable sets are created by the Ops/TFE team.
Workspace details are maintained in build-out documentation for IaC pipeline reference.
AC2: Service Principal and Permissions Management
Service Principal Names (SPNs) are provisioned by the IAM team based on requests.
Necessary permissions for subscription creation are granted to the admin SPN per environment.
AC3: CI/CD Pipeline for Infrastructure Deployment
Required documentation and automation tools for IaC deployment are accessible.
Jenkins supports CORP buildout, packaging configurations, and input files.
AC4: Configuration Management Standards
Infrastructure Landing Zone (LZ) templates follow a predefined structure.
Environment-specific configuration updates are managed via input files (tfvars).
AC5: Management Group and Subscription Governance
Management groups and subscriptions are configured as per predefined structures for organization, billing, and governance.
AC6: (Missing or Needs Clarification)
AC7: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Compliance
Role-based access is assigned and enforced consistently across environments.
RBAC policies ensure proper access control without manual intervention.
AC8: Operational and Compliance Policy Adherence
Corporate operational and DNS policies are implemented for each tenant.
Policies include tag inheritance, private endpoints, DNS integration, and AMA onboarding.
AC9: Platform Networking Resource Provisioning
Core networking components (subnets, security rules, DNS, etc.) are configured.
Infrastructure provisioning adheres to networking best practices and security standards.
AC10: Monitoring and Logging Mechanisms
Security, network, and operational logs are enabled for compliance.
Log data is stored in designated storage accounts and log analytics workspaces.
AC11: Key Management and Encryption Policies
Azure Key Vault is utilized for securing storage accounts and VM disks.
Data encryption is enforced with access restricted via private links.
AC12: Application Infrastructure Networking Standards
Defined networking components (virtual networks, subnets, security groups, peering) are deployed.
Core services such as Key Vault, storage accounts, and disk encryption adhere to security configurations.
AC13: Least Privilege Access for Application Provisioning
Application user SPNs receive only necessary permissions for infrastructure provisioning.
Access is controlled through Assignable-Based Access Control (ABAC) principles.
