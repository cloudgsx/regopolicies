1. Proposed Branching Workflow for Different Releases
a. Main Branches:
main branch:
This should represent the Corp-Prod environment.
Only stable, production-ready code should be merged here.
develop branch:
This should represent the Corp-Dev environment.
All feature and bugfix branches merge here via pull requests (PRs).
Acts as the integration branch for ongoing development.
b. Supporting Branches for Releases:
For each environment (UAT, Corp-Dev, Corp-UAT, Corp-Prod), create dedicated release branches. These branches will serve specific purposes for testing, validation, and deployment in each environment.

Release Branches:
Naming Convention: release/{environment} (e.g., release/uat, release/corp-uat).
Branch Creation: Always branched off from develop when a release is being prepared.
Merge Flow:
UAT Release (release/uat):
Branched from develop.
Post-testing and approval, merged back into develop and into release/corp-uat.
Corp-UAT Release (release/corp-uat):
Branched from release/uat after successful UAT.
Merged into develop and subsequently into release/corp-prod.
Corp-Prod Release (release/corp-prod):
Branched from release/corp-uat once testing and final validation are complete.
Merged into main for production deployment.
c. Merging Guidelines:
Always follow pull requests (PRs) for merging to ensure code reviews.
For hotfixes, branch from main, merge into both main and develop, and propagate to release branches as necessary.
2. Environment-Specific Guidance
UAT:
Use the release/uat branch for deployments.
Post testing, changes should be merged back into develop for integration.
Corp-Dev:
Use the develop branch directly for this environment to reflect ongoing development work.
Corp-UAT:
Use the release/corp-uat branch for deployments.
Ensure it includes fully tested code from release/uat.
Corp-Prod:
Use the release/corp-prod branch to deploy production-ready code.
Merge into main for final deployment.
3. Versioning and Tagging
Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) on the main branch for production releases.
Tag other branches (e.g., release/uat, release/corp-uat) with incremental pre-release identifiers (v1.0.0-uat, v1.0.0-corp-uat) to track deployment states in intermediate environments.
4. Advantages of This Approach
Clear isolation of development, testing, and production-ready code.
Dedicated release branches for each environment minimize conflicts and improve tracking.
Ensures traceability and smooth flow of code from develop to main.
If you'd like, I can further refine this workflow to address specific scenarios or integrate tooling suggestions like CI/CD pipeline recommendations. Let me know!

Here’s a summary table of the proposed branching strategy for handling UAT, Corp-Dev, Corp-UAT, and Corp-Prod:

Branch	Purpose	Environment	Branches From	Merges Into	Naming Convention
main	Production-ready, stable code	Corp-Prod	release/corp-prod	N/A	main
develop	Latest development and integration	Corp-Dev	Feature/Bugfix	release/uat	develop
release/uat	Code prepared for UAT testing	UAT	develop	release/corp-uat, develop	release/uat
release/corp-uat	Code validated post-UAT for corporate testing	Corp-UAT	release/uat	release/corp-prod, develop	release/corp-uat
release/corp-prod	Final testing and validation before production	Corp-Prod	release/corp-uat	main	release/corp-prod
Feature Branch	Development of specific features	N/A	develop	develop	feature/<feature-name>
Bugfix Branch	Fixing bugs in the develop branch	N/A	develop	develop	bugfix/<description>
Hotfix Branch	Critical fixes for production	N/A	main	main, develop	hotfix/<description>
