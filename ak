Steps to Remove a User-Managed Identity from a VM with AZAPI
Configure the Azure Provider in Terraform:

Ensure that the azapi provider is configured with your Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
Identify the Resource:

Locate the VM resource (Azure virtual machine) and the user-assigned identity that you want to dissociate.
Use the azapi_update_resource Resource:

The azapi_update_resource resource allows you to update the properties of Azure resources, including removing identities from VMs.
Set the Identity Property to None:

In the body of the update request, set the identity property to { "type": "None" } to remove the managed identity.


provider "azapi" {
  # Configure the Azure provider
  subscription_id = "your_subscription_id"
  tenant_id       = "your_tenant_id"
}

resource "azapi_update_resource" "remove_identity" {
  type       = "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-11-01"  # Azure VM resource type
  resource_id = "/subscriptions/your_subscription_id/resourceGroups/your_resource_group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/your_vm_name"

  # Set identity to None to remove user-assigned identity
  body = jsonencode({
    identity = {
      type = "None"
    }
  })
}


Key Points:
Replace your_subscription_id, your_tenant_id, your_resource_group, and your_vm_name with your specific Azure resource values.
The type property in azapi_update_resource must match the VM API version (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-11-01 in this example).
Setting the identity property to "None" effectively removes the identity.
