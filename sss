Title: Refine and Track JIRA Stories for Module Release

As a project manager,
I want to refine and track JIRA stories for module releases across different teams,
so that we can ensure all tasks are clearly defined, assigned, and ready for release.

Acceptance Criteria:

All JIRA stories listed in the shared module list are updated with refined descriptions, acceptance criteria, and effort estimations.
Each story is assigned to the relevant team member (as per the shared table).
All stories are moved to the "Ready to Release" stage in the JIRA workflow.
Communication is sent out to the team to confirm story refinement is complete and to track readiness for release.
Tasks:

 Refine the descriptions and acceptance criteria for each story (e.g., ECPKAC-2137, ECPKAC-2134, etc.).
 Assign stories to the relevant team members (e.g., Sam, Gent, Samiksha).
 Verify that the stories meet the "Ready to Release" stage criteria.
 Send an update to the team regarding the completed refinements.
Definition of Done:

All JIRA stories are in the "Ready to Release" stage.
Confirmation is received from all stakeholders that the stories are ready for deployment.
Documentation is updated for future reference.
