Document AWS Lab Instance Release Process

Story Description:
Currently, the AWS lab instance release process is known only through team member knowledge and not formally documented. This creates a risk of delays, inconsistencies, and knowledge loss. We need to create comprehensive documentation of the release process to ensure repeatability, transparency, and smoother onboarding of new team members.

Acceptance Criteria:

A step-by-step release process is documented in a central location (e.g., Confluence, internal wiki, or project repo).

Documentation includes:

Prerequisites (accounts, permissions, configurations).

Detailed release steps (including commands, scripts, and AWS services involved).

Validation/verification steps after release.

Rollback/recovery procedures if the release fails.

Documentation is peer-reviewed by at least one team member.

Documentation is accessible and linked in team knowledge base.

Priority: Medium (important for knowledge sharing and risk mitigation).

Story Points: (leave for your teamâ€™s estimation).

Additional Notes:

Engage SMEs who currently perform the process.

Capture screenshots or examples where appropriate.

Align documentation style with existing internal documentation standards.
