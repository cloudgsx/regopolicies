Title:
Test Azure policy enforcement for environment tag changes at lower subscription scope.

Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I need to validate Azure policies for the inheritance and enforcement of environment tags from the subscription level to lower scopes (e.g., resource groups or resources).
This validation should confirm:

How tag changes are enforced at a lower scope when updated at the subscription level.
Whether the inherited tag behavior aligns with the desired policy configurations.
Acceptance Criteria:
Validate that Azure policies enforce inheritance of environment tags at lower scopes when applied at the subscription level.
Test and confirm that changes to tags at the subscription level are correctly enforced at all applicable lower scopes.
Document and verify behavior when conflicting tag configurations exist at lower scopes.
Provide evidence (screenshots or logs) of successful enforcement.
Definition of Ready:
Azure subscription and resource group access is granted.
Required Azure policies for tag enforcement are configured and accessible.
Necessary documentation (e.g., existing policy definitions) is available.
Test data (e.g., environment tag values) is prepared and approved.
Definition of Done:
Validation scenarios are executed, and results meet acceptance criteria.
Testing results are documented and shared with the team (e.g., in Confluence or a relevant repository).
Any identified gaps in policy enforcement are logged as separate work items (e.g., bugs or improvements).
All relevant stakeholders review and approve the testing outcome.
Test Plan:
Test Scope: Functional validation of Azure policy inheritance for tags.
Test Cases:
Validate the default behavior of environment tag inheritance.
Test enforcement of tag updates from the subscription level to resource groups and resources.
Simulate and test conflict scenarios for tags at lower scopes.
Dependencies:
Access to the Azure environment and configured policies.
Tagging configurations to test inheritance and overrides.
Execution:
Use Azure Portal, PowerShell, or CLI to test policy inheritance.
Document findings for each test scenario.
Risks:
Misconfigured Policies:

Risk: Azure policies may not be configured correctly, leading to invalid test results.
Mitigation: Validate policy definitions and configurations before testing.
Access Issues:

Risk: Delays in gaining access to the required Azure subscription or resource groups may impede testing.
Mitigation: Ensure access is requested and granted before the sprint begins.
Policy Conflict Scenarios:

Risk: Conflicting tag configurations at lower scopes might override subscription-level tags in unintended ways.
Mitigation: Test edge cases to validate policy behavior under conflict scenarios.
Limited Test Coverage:

Risk: Testing may not cover all possible tag inheritance scenarios.
Mitigation: Develop comprehensive test cases that include common and edge cases.
Lack of Documentation:

Risk: Missing documentation of test outcomes could lead to confusion or rework.
Mitigation: Ensure that all test results are documented and shared promptly.
Dependency Delays:

Risk: Dependencies like test data or access to tools may cause delays.
Mitigation: Track dependencies and resolve them during sprint planning.
Environment Instability:

Risk: Unstable Azure environments during testing could lead to inconclusive results.
Mitigation: Plan tests during low-usage periods and use sandbox environments if possible.
