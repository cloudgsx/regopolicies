I hope you are both doing well.

I wanted to reach out to clarify my role and responsibilities regarding the [BAU] Research and POCs EPIC. As per [Manager’s Name] request, I collaborated on this initiative by reviewing, refining, and improving the content to ensure alignment with our engineering objectives.

However, the Product Owner, Pravin, has expressed concerns that this falls strictly under his responsibilities. He subsequently closed the EPIC and has also raised issues with the user stories I created, which has led to some tension. While I fully respect the PO’s ownership of backlog management, my intent was solely to contribute in good faith, aligning with the directive I received.

To ensure smooth collaboration moving forward, I would appreciate some guidance on how you’d like me to proceed in such cases. Should I continue supporting these efforts as requested, or would you prefer I step back to avoid overlapping responsibilities?

I value teamwork and want to ensure that our processes remain effective without creating unnecessary friction. Please let me know how you’d like to handle this moving forward.
