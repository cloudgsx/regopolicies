Clarify the Objective: The story is about documenting the Horizon IaC pipeline expectations and requirements for CORP3 and CORP2, including areas like vault, celestial, and xlr maturity.

Acceptance Criteria: It seems there are two main deliverables:

The documentation for IaC is reviewed and approved by leads.
Updates are made to the Engineering Confluence page.
Action Plan:

Gather Information: Collect details about the Horizon IaC pipeline, including its current implementation, maturity levels, and tools used (vault, celestial, xlr).
Design and Review:
Create detailed documentation outlining the pipeline's requirements and expectations.
Include relevant diagrams or architecture models if needed.
Share the documentation with the leads for review.
Update Confluence:
Summarize key points from the documentation.
Ensure any existing Confluence pages are updated or create a new page if required.
Readme Files and Config Changes:
If there are associated repos, ensure the README or associated config files are updated.
Next Steps:

Break the story into subtasks:
Research and Gather Requirements (Understand maturity for CORP3 and CORP2).
Draft Initial Documentation.
Review with Leads.
Update Confluence and Other Artifacts.
Assign each task appropriately, if working in a team.
Questions for Stakeholders:

Are there any specific formats or templates for documentation?
What level of detail is expected in Confluence updates?
Who are the lead reviewers, and how should the review be coordinated?









General Requirements and Expectations for a Pipeline
Functionality

Automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure.
Enable repeatable deployments with consistent results.
Include integrations with key tools such as CI/CD systems, repositories, and monitoring platforms.
Scalability

Support scaling infrastructure up or down depending on workload requirements.
Handle multiple environments (development, staging, production).
Security

Ensure sensitive data (e.g., secrets, passwords) is securely stored (e.g., Vault).
Include role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging.
Support compliance with organizational and industry standards.
Reliability

Handle failures gracefully with robust error reporting.
Provide rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.
Maintainability

Use modular and reusable code.
Document key configurations and workflows clearly.
Ensure pipeline jobs and scripts are version-controlled.
Monitoring and Observability

Provide logs and metrics to monitor the health of the pipeline.
Integrate with alerting tools for early failure detection.
Interoperability

Integrate with other systems like cloud providers, internal tools, or third-party services.
Support multiple IaC tools if needed (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
Performance

Optimize for quick deployments.
Ensure minimal downtime during deployments.



Specific Requirements for Horizon IaC Pipeline
Based on the provided Jira story, here are project-specific considerations:

Vault Integration

Ensure the pipeline securely integrates with Vault for managing secrets (API keys, credentials).
Define expectations for how secrets are accessed and rotated during pipeline execution.
Celestial Integration

Document how the pipeline interacts with Celestial for managing deployments.
Specify any configurations or prerequisites required by Celestial.
XLR (Release Orchestration) Integration

Describe how the pipeline utilizes XLR for orchestration and deployment workflows.
Ensure it supports staged releases or parallel deployments as per project needs.
Environment Maturity

Define the maturity levels expected for CORP3 and CORP2.
For example:
CORP3 may require a highly automated and resilient pipeline for production.
CORP2 may focus more on staging or development infrastructure with moderate automation.
Documentation and Onboarding

Specify that all pipeline configurations, workflows, and dependencies are documented for easy onboarding.
Include details on how to set up the pipeline locally for testing purposes.
Testing and Validation

Define unit tests for individual modules (e.g., Terraform modules).
Set up integration tests to validate that the pipeline successfully provisions and configures resources.
Confluence Integration

Expectations for the pipeline to have well-documented processes linked on Confluence.
Key Sections in the Documentation
When documenting these requirements and expectations, use the following structure:

Introduction

Overview of the pipeline.
Goals and objectives (e.g., automation, scalability, security).
Scope

What environments and use cases (CORP3 and CORP2) the pipeline will support.
Workflow

Detailed flow of pipeline stages, e.g., plan, validate, deploy, and monitor.
Tools and Integrations

Vault: How secrets are handled.
Celestial: Role in infrastructure management.
XLR: How release orchestration is achieved.
Requirements

Functional: Actions the pipeline should perform.
Non-functional: Security, scalability, reliability expectations.
Testing and Validation

Tests at each stage of the pipeline.
Process for reviewing IaC code.
Expected Outputs

Deployed infrastructure (e.g., VMs, networks, storage).
Logs and metrics for deployments.
Assumptions

Any prerequisites or assumptions for the pipeline to work (e.g., required tools installed, specific permissions).
Conclusion

Summary of how the pipeline supports CORP3 and CORP2.
