Terraform Coding Standards and Best Practices
Objective
To establish a set of Terraform coding standards and best practices to ensure consistent, secure, and maintainable infrastructure-as-code (IaC) across projects.

1. General Best Practices
Code Organization:

Use modules to encapsulate and reuse code.
Group related resources into logical files or folders.
Avoid hardcoding values; use variables instead.
Resource Naming:

Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., resource-type-environment-purpose).
Avoid long names to prevent hitting provider-specific character limits.
Version Control:

Pin Terraform versions in terraform { required_version = ">=1.5.0" } to avoid compatibility issues.
Maintain a consistent state file location (e.g., remote backends such as S3).
2. Security Best Practices
Secrets Management:

Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text or source control.
Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Terraform sensitive variables.
Least Privilege Principle:

Grant minimal IAM permissions to Terraform execution.
Limit access to Terraform state files to authorized personnel.
Input Validation:

Use variable validation rules (e.g., variable "instance_type" { validation { condition = contains(["t2.micro"], var.instance_type) } }).
3. Maintainability Best Practices
Formatting and Linting:

Enforce consistent formatting with terraform fmt.
Use tools like tflint for linting and detecting potential issues.
Documentation:

Document each module, variable, and output using comments or README files.
Use auto-documentation tools like terraform-docs to generate module documentation.
Dependencies:

Minimize dependencies by breaking monolithic configurations into smaller, reusable modules.
Use terraform state rm to clean up unused resources from state files.
4. Performance Best Practices
State Management:

Use remote backends (e.g., AWS S3) to store Terraform state files.
Enable state locking with tools like DynamoDB for AWS.
Resource Optimization:

Avoid creating excessive resources or redundant modules.
Regularly audit and clean up unused resources.
5. Tools for Code Quality
Linting and Testing Tools:

tflint: Detects errors, enforces style conventions, and checks for best practices.
checkov: Performs static analysis for security and policy compliance.
terraform validate: Validates the Terraform configuration.
terraform plan: Identifies potential changes before applying them.
CI/CD Integration:

Integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines to automate plan, validate, and apply steps.
Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for automation.
6. Example Standards
Category	Standard	Example
Formatting	Always use terraform fmt before committing.	terraform fmt -check in pre-commit hooks.
Variables	Use descriptive variable names.	variable "db_instance_size" {}
Module Usage	Group related resources into modules.	/modules/vpc, /modules/ecs
Outputs	Always define meaningful outputs.	output "vpc_id" { value = aws_vpc.main.id }
State Storage	Use remote backends with state locking enabled.	S3 + DynamoDB
