Title:
Enable removal of user-managed identity from VM using AzAPI

Description:
As a Platform Engineer,
I need to validate and enable the removal of user-managed identity from a virtual machine (VM) using AzAPI,
so that identity configurations can be updated or disassociated as required.

This involves:

Investigating and resolving the issue preventing user-managed identity removal from a VM.
Testing the provided AzAPI script to ensure functionality for identity removal.
Ensuring the solution is documented for future use.
Acceptance Criteria:
A functional AzAPI script is implemented that successfully removes the user-managed identity from a VM.
Verify the solution works for multiple scenarios (e.g., different VM configurations and subscriptions).
Logs and outputs confirm that the identity is disassociated without errors.
Documentation is updated with:
Steps to execute the AzAPI script.
Validation results for different scenarios.
Definition of Ready:
Access to the Azure environment and necessary permissions for testing AzAPI.
Sample VM with user-managed identity attached for testing.
Initial investigation notes and email chain for context are reviewed by the team.
Test data (e.g., subscription ID, tenant ID) is available.
Definition of Done:
The AzAPI script is developed, tested, and verified for functionality.
The issue of user-managed identity removal is resolved.
All relevant documentation (e.g., Confluence pages or README files) is updated with the solution and steps.
Validation results are shared with the team, and stakeholders approve the solution.
Technical Details:
Sample AzAPI code provided for reference:
hcl

provider "azapi" {
  subscription_id = "your_subscription_id"
  tenant_id       = "your_tenant_id"
}

resource "azapi_update_resource" "remove_identity" {
  type        = "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-11-01"
  resource_id = "/subscriptions/your_subscription_id/resourceGroups/your_resource_group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/your_vm_name"

  body = jsonencode({
    identity = {
      type = "None"
    }
  })
}


Risks:
Script Errors: The provided AzAPI code may not function as expected, leading to additional troubleshooting effort.
Mitigation: Test the script thoroughly in a non-production environment.
Permission Issues: Lack of necessary permissions may delay testing.
Mitigation: Ensure appropriate access is granted before the sprint starts.
Unintended Impact: Removing user-managed identity might impact dependent resources.
Mitigation: Validate dependencies before removing the identity.
Test Plan:
Test Scope: Functional validation of AzAPI script to remove user-managed identity.
Test Scenarios:
Verify the script successfully removes identity for a VM with standard configurations.
Test with different VM configurations and resource groups to ensure broad applicability.
Simulate failure scenarios (e.g., invalid resource IDs or insufficient permissions).
Execution:
Use Azure CLI or a sandbox environment to test and validate the solution.
Documentation:
Record results for each test scenario and update documentation with findings.
