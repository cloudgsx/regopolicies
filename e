AC 1:
Given that the infrastructure automation platform is set up and configured,
When the development team updates the environment configuration,
Then all required details (workspace settings, authentication credentials, and dependencies) should be readily available for deployment.

AC 2:
Given that predefined configuration sets have been assigned to all infrastructure environments,
When new workloads or applications are deployed,
Then the system should provision resources automatically without requiring manual adjustments.

AC 3:
Given that required service accounts and permissions have been requested and provisioned,
When authentication or authorization is needed,
Then credentials should be accessible in a centralized and secure repository.

AC 4:
Given that security and compliance policies have been defined,
When infrastructure components are deployed,
Then they must inherit and enforce all relevant policies without requiring manual intervention.

AC 5:
Given that a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is in place,
When development teams need to deploy infrastructure changes,
Then appropriate documentation and automation tools should be available for seamless integration.

AC 6:
Given that networking configurations and connectivity details are pre-defined,
When new infrastructure components are deployed,
Then they should automatically adhere to approved networking configurations and security best practices.

AC 7:
Given that monitoring and compliance frameworks are enabled,
When infrastructure deployments occur,
Then they must pass security, performance, and compliance validations before becoming fully operational.

AC 8:
Given that infrastructure modules and templates have been standardized,
When new environments are created,
Then they should reuse existing modules to ensure consistency and efficiency.
Key Functional Requirements

AC 9:
Given that resource management and subscription settings are predefined,
When new environments are deployed,
Then they should follow the correct structure for organization, billing, and governance.

AC 10:
Given that identity and access management policies are configured,
When users or services request access,
Then permissions should be applied based on predefined roles and access scopes.

AC 11:
Given that access control policies are enforced at multiple levels,
When new applications or services are provisioned,
Then access rights should be automatically assigned according to predefined governance rules.

AC 12:
Given that role-based access control (RBAC) configurations are updated,
When a new role needs to be assigned,
Then it should be applied consistently across environments without manual modifications.

AC 13:
Given that configuration management is required for infrastructure consistency,
When templates or configurations are updated,
Then the changes should be automatically applied across all environments.

AC 14:
Given that infrastructure deployment includes network configurations,
When network settings are applied,
Then they should align with security best practices, including segmentation, firewall rules, and routing policies.

AC 15:
Given that infrastructure templates provision core networking resources,
When environments are deployed,
Then all required components (network groups, subnets, security rules, DNS settings) should be correctly configured.

AC 16:
Given that key management and encryption policies are enforced,
When sensitive data or secrets are stored,
Then they should be securely encrypted and accessible only through authorized channels.

AC 17:
Given that monitoring and logging mechanisms are in place,
When infrastructure is provisioned,
Then all security, network, and operational logs should be collected and monitored for compliance and auditing.
