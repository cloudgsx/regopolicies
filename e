General Comments:
Conditional Logic for Boot Diagnostics (Line 7):

Good practice using a ternary operator to change replication type based on is_boot_diagnostic. This helps ensure specific settings for diagnostic storage accounts.

IP Rule Simplification (Lines 63-67):

You’ve neatly split proxy and serial console IPs using the condition. This makes the logic modular and readable.

However, consider extracting the ternary expressions into locals if the logic grows more complex or needs reuse.

Variable Management:

The new variables is_boot_diagnostic, bank_internet_proxy_ip, and Azure_serial_console_ip are well defined with descriptions and defaults.

You might want to validate IP formats with validation blocks, especially for production.

Removed Hardcoded IPs (Lines 94–122, second image):

Excellent improvement by moving the IPs to variables. Enhances maintainability and separation of concerns.

Naming Consistency:

Consider renaming Azure_serial_console_ip to azure_serial_console_ip to maintain naming style consistency (camelCase vs snake_case vs lowercase underscore).

Documentation:

Make sure the README or any module documentation is updated to reflect these new variables and their usage.
