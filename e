1. Gather Team Feedback on Terraform Codebase Improvements
Story Title: Gather Detailed Team Feedback on Current Terraform Codebase

As a platform engineer,
I want to collect structured feedback from engineers working with Terraform,
So that we can identify code quality issues, technical debt, and usability challenges in our current infrastructure codebase.

Background:
Our Terraform codebase has grown without formal standards. Before applying changes, it is essential to gather insights on common issues and improvement opportunities.

Acceptance Criteria:

Gather written or verbal feedback from at least 5 team members who have worked with Terraform in the last 3 months.

Include specific areas of concern (e.g., module structure, naming conventions, reusability).

Document feedback in a report grouped by category (syntax, structure, tooling, etc.).

Report is reviewed by a team lead and stored in a shared repository (e.g., Confluence or SharePoint).

2. Define Terraform Coding Standards
Story Title: Define and Document Terraform Code Standards and Review Checklist

As a platform engineer,
I want to define and document coding standards for Terraform,
So that the entire team can write infrastructure code that is consistent, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.

Background:
Lack of a centralized style guide has led to inconsistent code across modules, making maintenance and onboarding harder.

Acceptance Criteria:

Develop a Terraform coding style guide covering naming, folder structure, variable usage, module practices, and documentation.

Create a Terraform code review checklist (checkable items for reviewers).

Review the draft with at least 2 senior engineers.

Publish the final version in a shared, accessible location.

Communicate guide availability via team channel/email.

3. Integrate Terraform Code Quality Tools
Story Title: Automate Terraform Code Quality Checks via CI/CD Integration

As a platform engineer,
I want to integrate static analysis tools for Terraform into our CI/CD pipelines,
So that code issues are automatically detected and flagged during development and deployment.

Background:
Manual checks are inconsistent and time-consuming. Tools like tflint, tfsec, or checkov offer automated and reliable validations.

Acceptance Criteria:

Evaluate and select an appropriate code quality tool for Terraform.

Integrate the tool into the existing CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).

Tool runs automatically on PRs or merges to main.

Tool performs checks on at least one key existing module and returns results successfully.

Documentation updated to reflect how the tool works and how failures are handled.

4. Refactor Existing Terraform Code
Story Title: Refactor Terraform Modules to Align with New Coding Standards

As a platform engineer,
I want to refactor existing Terraform code to align with our newly defined standards and best practices,
So that the codebase is clean, consistent, and easier to manage going forward.

Background:
Legacy code contains duplicated patterns, inconsistent naming, and lacks modularity. Refactoring is necessary to enable better reuse and automation.

Acceptance Criteria:

Identify and prioritize at least 2 high-impact modules for refactoring.

Refactor these modules to follow new standards (naming, structure, input/output design).

Remove redundant or unused Terraform resources/variables.

All refactored code passes automated code quality checks and CI/CD validations.

Code is reviewed and approved by at least one senior engineer.

5. Update Terraform Documentation
Story Title: Update Terraform Documentation with Standards, Tools, and Usage Guidelines

As a platform engineer,
I want to update existing Terraform documentation to include current standards, tools, and best practices,
So that engineers have accurate reference material when writing or reviewing Terraform code.

Background:
Current documentation is outdated and lacks structure. Updated documentation improves onboarding and developer productivity.

Acceptance Criteria:

Add/update documentation for:

Terraform coding standards

Tooling instructions (tflint, tfsec, etc.)

CI/CD integration steps

Code review process

Ensure documentation includes examples and visuals (e.g., folder layout, sample variables.tf).

Reviewed and approved by at least one team lead or architect.

Stored in an agreed team knowledge base (Confluence, Wiki, etc.).

6. Conduct Terraform Training Sessions
Story Title: Host Team Training Sessions on Terraform Best Practices and Tooling

As a platform lead,
I want to conduct live training sessions on Terraform coding practices, standards, and tooling,
So that all team members are equipped to write high-quality code and follow processes consistently.

Background:
Recent standards and tools are new to the team. Training will help align developers and avoid regressions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Prepare a presentation or interactive demo covering:

Terraform coding standards

Static analysis tools and usage

Common pitfalls and solutions

Conduct at least two training sessions (can be recorded).

Include a brief survey or feedback form after sessions.

Receive positive feedback from at least 80% of participants (e.g., "useful", "clear", "relevant").
