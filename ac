🔹 Step 1: Conduct a Brainstorming Session
📌 Goal: Define key engineering objectives for development efficiency and quality.

Approach:

Gather input from developers, tech leads, and DevOps engineers.
Identify challenges in coding, testing, CI/CD, security, and scalability.
Prioritize objectives that impact speed, quality, and maintainability.
📝 Actionable Tasks:
✅ Schedule a brainstorming meeting (1 hour) with the team.
✅ Use a collaborative document (Notion, Confluence, Miro) for idea collection.
✅ Define 5-7 key engineering objectives.

📌 Deliverable: A list of prioritized objectives focused on improving development processes.

🔹 Step 3: Define Measurable Success Criteria
📌 Goal: Convert high-level objectives into measurable goals.

📊 Example Engineering Objectives & Metrics
Objective	Measurable KPI
Improve code quality	100% PR code reviews + reduce bug rate by 30%
Speed up CI/CD pipelines	Reduce deployment time from 15 min to 5 min
Increase test coverage	Achieve 90% unit test coverage on core services
Reduce Tech Debt	Refactor 50% of legacy services
Enhance API Security	Ensure 100% API authentication coverage (OAuth/JWT/mTLS)
📝 Actionable Tasks:
✅ Assign KPIs to each engineering objective.
✅ Identify tools to measure and track progress (SonarQube, GitHub Actions, etc.).
✅ Set quarterly review cycles for engineering metrics.

📌 Deliverable: A Tech KPI Dashboard (JIRA/Confluence) to track progress.


🔹 Step 4: Document the Finalized Objectives
📌 Goal: Store objectives in a centralized, accessible place.

📝 Actionable Tasks:
✅ Draft an Engineering Roadmap Document (Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki).
✅ Include:

Finalized objectives & success metrics.
Ownership (team or individual owners).
Timeline for execution (short-term vs. long-term goals).
✅ Set up JIRA Epics and Stories to track execution.
📌 Deliverable:
📄 A formal engineering roadmap document (I can help draft this!).
✅ JIRA tickets for implementation.
