Observations
Too Many Nested Sections: The documentation has deep nesting, making it harder to navigate.
Deprecated Pages Not Clearly Marked: There's a section for deprecated pages, but it's mixed with active documentation.
Lack of Categorization: Items such as onboarding, architectural decisions, and compliance-related documents appear unorganized.
No Clear Naming Conventions: Some pages have unclear titles, like "New User GES - Request Namespace Access," which may not be intuitive for users.
Redundant or Similar Pages: There are multiple onboarding-related pages, which might create confusion.



Recommendations for Improvement
1. Improve Navigation with a Clearer Hierarchy
Reduce the depth of nested sections to make navigation easier.
Use clear, high-level categories such as:
Getting Started (Onboarding)
Architecture & Design
Platform & Deployment
Security & Compliance
Deprecated & Archived Content
Move "Deprecated Pages" to a separate archive with clear labels.
2. Establish Naming Conventions
Standardize document titles, e.g., instead of "New User Azure CLI Installation/Setup (Mac)," use "Azure CLI Setup (Mac) - Onboarding Guide."
Use prefixes for consistency:
[Guide] for step-by-step tutorials
[Reference] for technical details
[Policy] for governance documents
3. Merge or Eliminate Redundant Documents
Combine similar onboarding pages into a single comprehensive guide.
Use FAQs to cover common onboarding issues rather than having multiple documents.
Consolidate authentication-related documents under a single security guide.
4. Improve Searchability with Tags & Indexing
Implement tagging for key topics (e.g., Terraform, Azure CLI, Onboarding).
Create a master index page with links to important documentation.
5. Add Summaries for Each Section
Each major section should have a brief summary explaining what it contains.
Use FAQs or Quick Links at the top of each major category.
6. Review & Archive Old Documentation Regularly
Clearly mark deprecated pages (e.g., with a banner or different text color).
Set a review schedule (e.g., every 6 months) to archive outdated content.
