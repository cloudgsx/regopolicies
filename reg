Limitations of Custom Fields in Jira

Performance impact

Each custom field you add increases indexing and database load.

Too many custom fields (especially global ones) can slow down searches, reports, and overall Jira performance.

Global vs. Context-specific fields

By default, custom fields are global (available to all projects), which clutters screens and affects performance.

Best practice is to limit scope to specific projects/issue types.

Field types are predefined

You can’t just create any arbitrary data type. Jira provides a fixed set (e.g., text, number, date, checkbox, select list, cascading select).

For more complex needs, you need plugins or Jira apps (like ScriptRunner, Forge apps, or Jira Misc Custom Fields).

UI placement is limited

Fields can be added to screens, but positioning within the UI is fixed by Jira’s layout (unless you customize with apps or API).

Reporting and JQL search constraints

Some custom field types don’t support advanced JQL queries out of the box.

Example: Multi-select fields are harder to filter with.

Permission & visibility

Field visibility depends on screens, field configurations, and permission schemes.

Can be tricky to manage across multiple projects.

Cloud vs. Server/Data Center differences

Jira Cloud has stricter limits (no direct database access, limited plugin options, Atlassian-managed infrastructure).

Server/DC allows deeper customization but requires self-management.
