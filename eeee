Architecture Design Overview
The following diagram illustrates the Organization Landing Zone architecture for Corp3 within the ECP NextGen environment. The design establishes a structured hierarchy for Azure resource governance, including:

Management Groups (MG): Organize subscriptions based on environment and workload types (e.g., Connectivity, Operations, GIS, Data Services).

Subscriptions: Linked under respective management groups to separate concerns like Image Factory, App Landing Zone, Connectivity, Security Operations, and Data Services.

Resource Groups and Landing Zones:

L1 (Landing Zone Level 1): Establishes base resources like VNet, Subnets, Route Tables, and Key Vaults.

L2 (Landing Zone Level 2): Provides additional services such as Azure Monitor, Private Endpoints, Private DNS zones, and Security Logging (e.g., Azure Activity Logs).

Service Principles:

Subscriptions are peered where required (VNet Peering).

Resource deployments are modular and tied to the management group and subscription structure.

Key resource areas include:

IAM and Directory Management through legacy structures and O365.

Security Operations via GIS Security Labs.

Data Services connected with Virtual Networks and centralized monitoring.

Logging and Monitoring centralized under Platform Logging Subscriptions.

This modular and layered structure ensures:

Simplified governance and policy enforcement.

Clear separation of duties across environments.

Scalability for future cloud growth.

Key Components Seen in the Diagram:

Component	Description
Management Groups (MGs)	Logical containers grouping subscriptions for governance.
Subscriptions	Individual Azure billing and resource containers assigned by purpose.
VNet Peering	Secure, high-speed connectivity between virtual networks.
Private Endpoints & DNS	Secure connections between Azure services over private IP addresses.
Key Vaults	Centralized storage for sensitive information like secrets and certificates.
Azure Activity Logs	Captures operations and security events across the Azure environment.
Data Collection Endpoints	Enable advanced telemetry and monitoring capabilities for GIS and Data Services.



Detailed (Technical Audience) Description
The Organization Landing Zone architecture for Corp3 is designed with a multi-layered structure across management groups and subscriptions.

Management Groups (MGs) provide centralized governance across different operational domains, including Connectivity, Operations, Security, GIS, and Data Services.

Under each MG, specific Azure subscriptions are provisioned for resource isolation and workload specialization, such as:

Image Factory for golden image management.

App Test subscription for application landing zones.

Security Operations subscriptions for GIS environments.

Platform Logging subscriptions for centralized monitoring.

Landing Zone Levels:

Level 1 (L1): Core resource setup like Virtual Networks (VNets), Route Tables, Key Vaults.

Level 2 (L2): Extended services including Private Endpoints, Azure Monitor, and Activity Logs.

VNet Peering is extensively used to interconnect isolated VNets across subscriptions securely.

The architecture enforces clear separation of duties, modular expansion, and enhanced security, supporting current operational needs and future scalability.

✏️ Simplified (Executive/Leadership Audience) Description
The Corp3 Landing Zone architecture creates a scalable, secure cloud foundation by organizing Azure environments into layers.

Top Layer: Management Groups organize environments by purpose (Operations, Security, Data Services).

Middle Layer: Subscriptions under each group separate major workloads (e.g., App Development, Security Monitoring).

Bottom Layer: Resources like Networks, Databases, and Monitoring Tools are deployed with strict access controls and logging.

Connectivity between workloads is managed securely through Virtual Network Peering, enabling collaboration while maintaining isolation.

This structure ensures strong governance, rapid scaling, and secure cloud operations aligned to business growth.
