Title:
Develop Azure Automation Account Using L3 Template for CADA-Approved Use Case

Description:
As a Foundations Engineer,
I want to use the Azure Automation Account L3 Template to provision automation accounts for the CADA-approved “limited use” case,
so that hybrid worker VM and dependent resources are configured and operational as per requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:

Deploy the automation account with the hybrid worker VM and its dependent resources.
Validate the deployment by executing the provided test scripts to ensure all permissions for runbook execution are in place.
Ensure the following documentation is updated as applicable:
Design document changes.
Repository README file updates.
Updates or creation of Confluence pages for tracking and reference.
Definition of Ready (DoR):

Dependencies and impacted items are identified and confirmed.
Required permissions and resources (e.g., repository, templates, and tools) are available.
Test scripts for validation are reviewed and ready to use.
Definition of Done (DoD):

Azure Automation Account is deployed successfully with all necessary resources, including:
Hybrid Runbook Worker VM.
Hybrid Runbook Worker Group.
Virtual Machine and PE.
Test scripts confirm all runbook execution permissions are correctly configured.
All relevant documentation, including design documents, README files, and Confluence pages, is updated.
Necessary approvals are completed, and the deployment is aligned with CADA-approved use cases.
Tasks:

Deploy Azure Automation Account using the L3 Template.
Validate the deployment using the provided test scripts for runbook execution permissions.
Update the README file in the repository to include details about the deployment.
Update design documents to reflect the new deployment.
Update or create Confluence pages to document the setup and usage of the automation account.
Ensure dependencies such as Hybrid Runbook Worker, Hybrid Runbook Worker Group, and VM configurations are validated and functional.
Dependencies:

Access to the Azure Automation Account L3 Template and associated resources.
Required permissions for provisioning resources.
Risks:

Misconfiguration during deployment may lead to failure in automation account functionality.
Missing or incomplete documentation updates could impact operational use.
Deliverables:

Fully deployed and operational Azure Automation Account with hybrid worker VM and associated resources.
Updated documentation, including README files, design documents, and Confluence pages.
Validated and approved deployment aligned with CADA-approved use cases.
