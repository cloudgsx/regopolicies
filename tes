1. Goal
Describe the Azure Automation Landing Zones (L1, L2, and L3) and their role in Cloud 2.0.

Provide an architectural visualization of the Azure Automation Landing Zone and related resources.

Represent the execution workflow for Azure Automation in relation to other Platform Landing Zones.

Provide essential information for setting up Azure Automation across L1, L2, and L3 stages.

2. Background and Strategic Fit
Azure Landing Zones are established to equip application teams with the infrastructure necessary for cloud workload deployments.

The Azure Automation Landing Zone:

Level 1 (L1): Deploys base services — Networking, Key Vault, Storage Account for artifacts.

Level 2 (L2): Builds on Level 1 by setting up core application infrastructure services (e.g., Virtual Network, Subnets).

Level 3 (L3): Further extends the application environment by adding automation resources like Log Analytics Workspaces and Hybrid Runbook Workers.

This structured approach ensures scalability, security, and manageability for application teams onboarding onto Cloud 2.0.

3. Prerequisites
Before executing the Application Landing Zone templates:

Add a private hosted zone entry in Connectivity L1 for Azure Automation domains.

Create required Resource Groups.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) with two subnets, and configure the associated Network Security Groups (NSGs).

Set up the Azure Automation baseline with a Hybrid Runbook Worker.

4. Overview
Connectivity Level 1 Landing Zone (Example)
Subscription Name: sub-corp3-d-71148-con-1

Purpose: Establishes core networking and private DNS zones necessary for Azure Automation and Platform Services.

5. Architecture Design
Cloud 2.0 – Landing Zones Buildout Execution Order
The below diagram illustrates the sequence for building the Landing Zones:

Platform Landing Zones:

Organization L1

Connectivity L0, Connectivity L1, Key Vault L1, Logging L1

Connectivity L2, Operations L1

Application Landing Zones:

Azure Automation L0, L1, L2, and L3

Each stage depends on successful completion of the preceding levels, ensuring a modular, scalable deployment.

Key Note: Azure Automation L0 creates the core networking, while L1–L3 layers deploy application-specific resources and automation capabilities.

Azure Automation Landing Zone Architecture (Detailed View)
The Application Landing Zone (Automation) consists of:

Azure Resource Graph

Log Analytics Workspace

Azure Automation Account (including Hybrid Runbook Workers)

VNet Peering to Platform Landing Zones

Report Generation Services

This design ensures secure communication and monitoring across hybrid and cloud-only environments.

6. Azure Automation Account Approved Use Cases
Core Networking Resource Provisioning

Application Storage and KeyVault Access

Log Analytics Workspace Integration

Automation Resource Deployment (e.g., Hybrid Runbook Worker setup)

Cross-subscription resource access management

7. Questions/Comments (Optional)
Capture any additional improvements, feedback, or required updates for Azure Automation Landing Zones.

And here’s a description you could add below the diagrams:

Landing Zones Buildout Diagram – Explanation
This diagram outlines the build sequence for Landing Zones in Cloud 2.0:

The top (yellow section) lists prerequisites.

The middle (blue section) shows Platform Landing Zones being deployed in order.

The bottom (green section) shows Application Landing Zones for Azure Automation L0–L3, including resource assignments, networking, and key vault access.

This sequential deployment ensures all dependencies are addressed before application onboarding.

Azure Automation Architecture Diagram – Explanation
This diagram shows the Application Landing Zone's internal setup:

A Virtual Network is provisioned, containing Azure Automation resources.

Core resources like the Log Analytics Workspace and Hybrid Runbook Workers are deployed.

The Application VNet is peered with the Platform Infrastructure VNets for centralized logging, monitoring, and key management.
